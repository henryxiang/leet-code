A[3] is also the largest value, but 2 is a smaller index, so we can only jump to i = 2 and not i = 3.\r\n\r\nDuring our 3rd jump (odd numbered), we jump from i = 2 to i = 3 because A[3] is the smallest value in (A[3], A[4]) that is greater than or equal to A[2].\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t jump from i = 3 to i = 4, so the starting index i = 0 is not good.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, we can deduce that:\r\nFrom starting index i = 1, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\r\nFrom starting index i = 2, we jump to i = 3, and then we can&#39;t jump anymore.\r\nFrom starting index i = 3, we jump to i = 4, so we reach the end.\r\nFrom starting index i = 4, we are already at the end.\r\nIn total, there are 3 different starting indexes (i = 1, i = 3, i = 4) where we can reach the end with some number of jumps.\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<strong>Input: </strong><span id=\"example-input-3-1\">[5,1,3,4,2]</span>\r\n<strong>Output: </strong><span id=\"example-output-3\">3</span>\r\n<strong>Explanation: </strong>\r\nWe can reach the end from starting indexes 1, 2, and 4.\r\n</pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000</code></li>\r\n\t<li><code>0 &lt;= A[i] &lt; 100000</code></li>\r\n</ol>",

If we somehow knew these jumps, we could solve the problem by a simple traversal.\n\nSo the problem reduces to solving this question: for some index `i` during an odd numbered jump, what index do we jump to (if any)?  The question for even-numbered jumps is similar.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nLet's figure out where index `i` jumps to, assuming this is an odd-numbered jump.\n\nLet's consider each value of `A` in order from smallest to largest.  When we consider a value `A[j] = v`, we search the values we have already processed (which are `<= v`) from largest to smallest.  If we find that we have already processed some value `v0 = A[i]` with `i < j`, then we know `i` jumps to `j`.\n\nNaively this is a little slow, but we can speed this up with a common trick for harder problems: a monotonic stack.  (For another example of this technique, please see the solution to this problem: [(Article - Sum of Subarray Minimums)](https://leetcode.com/articles/sum-of-subarray-minimums/))\n\nLet's store the indices `i` of the processed values `v0 = A[i]` in a stack, and maintain the invariant that this is monotone decreasing.  When we add a new index `j`, we pop all the smaller indices `i < j` from the stack, which all jump to `j`.\n\nAfterwards, we know `oddnext[i]`, the index where `i` jumps to if this is an odd numbered jump.  Similarly, we know `evennext[i]`.  We can use this information to quickly build out all reachable states using dynamic programming.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://leetcode.com/playground/fYvxEXx8/shared\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"fYvxEXx8\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \\log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n---\n#### Approach 2: Tree Map\n\n**Intuition**\n\nAs in *Approach 1*, the problem reduces to solving this question: for some index `i` during an odd numbered jump, what index do we jump to (if any)?\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nWe can use a `TreeMap`, which is an excellent structure for maintaining sorted data.  Our map `vals` will map values `v = A[i]` to indices `i`.\n\nIterating from `i = N-2` to `i = 0`, we have some value `v = A[i]` and we want to know what the next largest or next smallest value is.  The `TreeMap.lowerKey` and `TreeMap.higherKey` functions do this for us.\n\nWith this in mind, the rest of the solution is straightforward: we use dynamic programming to maintain `odd[i]` and `even[i]`: whether the state of being at index `i` on an odd or even numbered jump is possible to reach.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://leetcode.com/playground/RtJL4zUR/shared\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"RtJL4zUR\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \\log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n---\nAnalysis written by: [@awice](https://leetcode.com/awice).",
