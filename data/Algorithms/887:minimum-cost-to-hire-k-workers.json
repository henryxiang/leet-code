If not, we could scale all payments down by some factor and still keep everyone earning more than their wage expectation.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nFor each `captain` worker that will be paid their minimum wage expectation, let's calculate the cost of hiring K workers where each point of quality is worth `wage[captain] / quality[captain]` dollars.  With this approach, the remaining implementation is straightforward.\n\nNote that this algorithm would not be efficient enough to pass larger test cases.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://leetcode.com/playground/6wfBasLL/shared\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"6wfBasLL\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2 \\log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of workers.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n---\n#### Approach 2: Heap\n\n**Intuition**\n\nAs in *Approach #1*, at least one worker is paid their minimum wage expectation.\n\nAdditionally, every worker has some minimum `ratio` of dollars to quality that they demand.  For example, if `wage[0] = 100` and `quality[0] = 20`, then the `ratio` for worker 0 is `5.0`.\n\nThe key insight is to iterate over the ratio.  Let's say we hire workers with a ratio `R` or lower.  Then, we would want to know the `K` workers with the lowest quality, and the sum of that quality.  We can use a heap to maintain these variables.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nMaintain a max heap of quality.  (We're using a minheap, with negative values.)  We'll also maintain `sumq`, the sum of this heap.\n\nFor each worker in order of ratio, we know all currently considered workers have lower ratio.  (This worker will be the 'captain', as described in *Approach #1*.)  We calculate the candidate answer as this ratio times the sum of the smallest K workers in quality.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://leetcode.com/playground/KRXJr8dq/shared\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" name=\"KRXJr8dq\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \\log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of workers.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n---\n\n\nAnalysis written by: [@awice](https://leetcode.com/awice).",
