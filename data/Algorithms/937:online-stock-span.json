In a typical case, we get a new element like `7`, and there are some previous elements like `11, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4`.  Let's try to create some relationship between this query and the next query.\n\nIf (after getting `7`) we get an element like `2`, then the answer is `1`.  So in general, whenever we get a smaller element, the answer is 1.\n\nIf we get an element like `8`, the answer is 1 plus the previous answer (for `7`), as the `8` \"stops\" on the same value that `7` does (namely, `9`).\n\nIf we get an element like `10`, the answer is 1 plus the previous answer, plus the answer for `9`.\n\nNotice throughout this evaluation, we only care about elements that occur in increasing order - we \"shortcut\" to them.  That is, from adding an element like `10`, we cut to `7` [with \"weight\" 4], then to `9` [with weight 2], then cut to `11` [with weight 1].\n\nA stack is the ideal data structure to maintain what we care about efficiently.\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nLet's maintain a weighted stack of decreasing elements.  The size of the weight will be the total number of elements skipped.  For example, `11, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 7` will be `(11, weight=1), (9, weight=2), (7, weight=4)`.\n\nWhen we get a new element like `10`, this helps us count the previous values faster by popping weighted elements off the stack.  The new stack at the end will look like `(11, weight=1), (10, weight=7)`.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://leetcode.com/playground/5aJytT6D/shared\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"395\" name=\"5aJytT6D\"></iframe>\n\n**Complexity Analysis**\n\n* Time Complexity:  $$O(Q)$$, where $$Q$$ is the number of calls to `StockSpanner.next`.  In total, there are $$Q$$ pushes to the stack, and at most $$Q$$ pops.\n\n* Space Complexity:  $$O(Q)$$.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n\n---\n\n\nAnalysis written by: [@awice](https://leetcode.com/awice).",
