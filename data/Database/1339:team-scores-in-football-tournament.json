Points are awarded as follows:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A team&nbsp;receives three points if they win&nbsp;a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).</li>\n\t<li>A team&nbsp;receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).</li>\n\t<li>A team&nbsp;receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Write an SQL query that selects the <strong>team_id</strong>, <strong>team_name</strong> and <strong>num_points</strong> of each team in the tournament after all described matches. Result table should be ordered by <strong>num_points</strong> (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by <strong>team_id</strong> (increasing order).</p>\n\n<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code>Teams </code>table:\n+-----------+--------------+\n| team_id   | team_name    |\n+-----------+--------------+\n| 10        | Leetcode FC  |\n| 20        | NewYork FC   |\n| 30        | Atlanta FC   |\n| 40        | Chicago FC   |\n| 50        | Toronto FC   |\n+-----------+--------------+\n\n<code>Matches </code>table:\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\n| match_id   | host_team    | guest_team    | host_goals  | guest_goals  |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\n| 1          | 10           | 20            | 3           | 0            |\n| 2          | 30           | 10            | 2           | 2            |\n| 3          | 10           | 50            | 5           | 1            |\n| 4          | 20           | 30            | 1           | 0            |\n| 5          | 50           | 30            | 1           | 0            |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+\n\nResult table:\n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n| team_id    | team_name    | num_points    |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n| 10         | Leetcode FC  | 7             |\n| 20         | NewYork FC   | 3             |\n| 50         | Toronto FC   | 3             |\n| 30         | Atlanta FC   | 1             |\n| 40         | Chicago FC   | 0             |\n+------------+--------------+---------------+\n</pre>\n",
