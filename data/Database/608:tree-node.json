In this case, we can use [`CASE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/case.html) statement.\n\n**MySQL**\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    id AS `Id`,\n    CASE\n        WHEN tree.id = (SELECT atree.id FROM tree atree WHERE atree.p_id IS NULL)\n          THEN 'Root'\n        WHEN tree.id IN (SELECT atree.p_id FROM tree atree)\n          THEN 'Inner'\n        ELSE 'Leaf'\n    END AS Type\nFROM\n    tree\nORDER BY `Id`\n;\n```\n>MySQL provides different flow control statements besides `CASE`. You can try to rewrite the slution above using [`IF`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/control-flow-functions.html#function_if) flow control statement.\n\n#### Approach III: Using `IF` function [Accepted]\n\n**Algorithm**\n\nAlso, we can use a single [`IF`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/control-flow-functions.html#function_if) function instead of the complex flow control statements.\n\n**MySQL**\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    atree.id,\n    IF(ISNULL(atree.p_id),\n        'Root',\n        IF(atree.id IN (SELECT p_id FROM tree), 'Inner','Leaf')) Type\nFROM\n    tree atree\nORDER BY atree.id\n```\n>Note: This solution was inspired by [@richarddia](https://discuss.leetcode.com/user/richarddia)",
