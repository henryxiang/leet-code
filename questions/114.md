#114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List | Algorithms | Medium | Tree, Depth-first Search

Category: Algorithms
Difficulty: Medium
Tags: Tree, Depth-first Search

Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

For example, given the following tree:


    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6


The flattened tree should look like:


1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
