Category: Algorithms
Difficulty: Medium
Tags: Linked List

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

 

Example:


Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
