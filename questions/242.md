Category: Algorithms
Difficulty: Easy
Tags: Hash Table, Sort

Given two strings s and tÂ , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of s.

Example 1:


Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true


Example 2:


Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false


Note:
You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.

Follow up:
What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such case?
