#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition**

The simplest strategy here is to use recursion. 
Check if `p` and `q` nodes are not `None`, and their values are equal.
If all checks are OK, do the same for the child nodes
recursively.

**Implementation**

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, 
where N is a number of nodes in the tree, since one visits
each node exactly once.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$$ in the best case of completely 
balanced tree and $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ in the worst case
of completely unbalanced tree, to keep a recursion stack.

#### Approach 2: Iteration

**Intuition**

Start from the root and then at each iteration 
pop the current node out of the deque. Then do the same checks as in
 the approach 1 :

- `p` and `p` are not `None`, 

- `p.val` is equal to `q.val`,

and if checks are OK, push the child nodes.
