#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

Let's try to write some number in the answer digit by digit.

For each digit except the first, there are at most 2 choices for that digit.  This means that there are at most $$9 * 2^8$$ possible 9 digit numbers, for example.  This is small enough to brute force.

**Algorithm**

An $$N$$ digit number is just an $$N-1$$ digit number with a final digit added.  If the $$N-1$$ digit number ends in a digit $$d$$, then the $$N$$ digit number will end in $$d-K$$ or $$d+K$$ (provided these are digits in the range $$[0,9]$$).  We store these numbers in a `Set` structure to avoid duplicates.

Also, we should be careful about leading zeroes -- only 1 digit numbers will start with `0`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$.
