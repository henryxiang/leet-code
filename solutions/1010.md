#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

If $$x^i > \text{bound}$$, the sum $$x^i + y^j$$ can't be less than or equal to the bound.  Similarly for $$y^j$$.

Thus, we only have to check for $$0 \leq i, j \leq \log_x(\text{bound}) < 18$$.

We can use a `HashSet` to store all the different values.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\log^2{\text{bound}})$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(\log^2{\text{bound}})$$.
