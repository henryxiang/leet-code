#### Approach 1: Prefix Sums and Counting

**Intuition**

As is typical with problems involving subarrays, we use prefix sums to add each subarray.  Let `P[i+1] = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[i]`.  Then, each subarray can be written as `P[j] - P[i]` (for `j > i`).  Thus, we have `P[j] - P[i]` equal to `0` modulo `K`, or equivalently `P[i]` and `P[j]` are the same value modulo `K`.

**Algorithm**

Count all the `P[i]`'s modulo `K`.  Let's say there are $$C_x$$ values $$P[i] \equiv x \pmod{K}$$.  Then, there are $$\sum_x \binom{C_x}{2}$$ possible subarrays.

For example, take `A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1]` and `K = 5`.  Then `P = [0,4,9,9,7,4,5]`, and $$C_0 = 2, C_2 = 1, C_4 = 4$$:

* With $$C_0 = 2$$ (at $$P[0]$$, $$P[6]$$), it indicates $$\binom{2}{2} = 1$$ subarray with sum divisible by $$K$$, namely $$A[0:6] = [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1]$$.
* With $$C_4 = 4$$ (at $$P[1]$$, $$P[2]$$, $$P[3]$$, $$P[5]$$), it indicates $$\binom{4}{2} = 6$$ subarrays with sum divisible by $$K$$, namely $$A[1:2]$$, $$A[1:3]$$, $$A[1:5]$$, $$A[2:3]$$, $$A[2:5]$$, $$A[3:5]$$.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.  (However, the solution can be modified to use $$O(K)$$ space by storing only `count`.)
