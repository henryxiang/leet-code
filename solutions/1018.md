1018. Largest Perimeter Triangle | Algorithms | Easy | Math, Sort

[TOC]

## Solution

#### Approach 1: Sort

**Intuition**

Without loss of generality, say the sidelengths of the triangle are $$a \leq b \leq c$$.  The necessary and sufficient condition for these lengths to form a triangle of non-zero area is $$a + b > c$$.

Say we knew $$c$$ already.  There is no reason not to choose the largest possible $$a$$ and $$b$$ from the array.  If $$a + b > c$$, then it forms a triangle, otherwise it doesn't.

**Algorithm**

This leads to a simple algorithm:  Sort the array.  For any $$c$$ in the array, we choose the largest possible $$a \leq b \leq c$$:  these are just the two values adjacent to $$c$$.  If this forms a triangle, we return the answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
