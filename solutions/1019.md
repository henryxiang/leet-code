## Solution

#### Approach 1: Sort

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Create an array of the squares of each element, and sort them.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: Two Pointer

**Intuition**

Since the array `A` is sorted, loosely speaking it has some negative elements with squares in decreasing order, then some non-negative elements with squares in increasing order.

For example, with `[-3, -2, -1, 4, 5, 6]`, we have the negative part `[-3, -2, -1]` with squares `[9, 4, 1]`, and the positive part `[4, 5, 6]` with squares `[16, 25, 36]`.  Our strategy is to iterate over the negative part in reverse, and the positive part in the forward direction.

**Algorithm**

We can use two pointers to read the positive and negative parts of the array - one pointer `j` in the positive direction, and another `i` in the negative direction.

Now that we are reading two increasing arrays (the squares of the elements), we can merge these arrays together using a two-pointer technique.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
