#### Approach 1: HashMap + Binary Search

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each `key` we get or set, we only care about the timestamps and values for that key.  We can store this information in a `HashMap`.

Now, for each `key`, we can binary search the sorted list of timestamps to find the relevant `value` for that `key`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(1)$$ for each `set` operation, and $$O(\log N)$$ for each `get` operation, where $$N$$ is the number of entries in the `TimeMap`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: TreeMap

**Intuition and Algorithm**

In `Java`, we can use `TreeMap.floorKey(timestamp)` to find the largest timestamp smaller than the given `timestamp`.

We build our solution in the same way as *Approach 1*, swapping in this functionality.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(1)$$ for each `set` operation, and $$O(\log N)$$ for each `get` operation, where $$N$$ is the number of entries in the `TimeMap`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
