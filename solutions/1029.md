#### Approach 1: Store Locations

**Intuition**

It's evident that there are two steps in a straightforward solution: first, find the location of every node, then report their locations.

**Algorithm**

To find the location of every node, we can use a depth-first search.  During the search, we will maintain the location `(x, y)` of the node.  As we move from parent to child, the location changes to `(x-1, y+1)` or `(x+1, y+1)` depending on if it is a left child or right child.  [We use `y+1` to make our sorting by decreasing `y` easier.]

To report the locations, we sort them by `x` coordinate, then `y` coordinate, so that they are in the correct order to be added to our answer.

Please see the inline comments for more details.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the given tree.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
