1030. Smallest String Starting From Leaf | Algorithms | Medium | Tree, Depth-first Search

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

Let's create every possible string - then we can compare them and choose the best one.

**Algorithm**

In our depth first search, we will maintain `sb` (or `A` in Python), the contents of a path from the root to this node.

When we reach a leaf, we will reverse this path to create a candidate answer.  If it is better than our current answer, we'll update our answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  We use $$O(N)$$ to traverse the array and maintain `A` [Python] or `sb`.  Then, our reversal and comparison with the previous answer is $$O(L)$$, where $$L$$ is the size of the string we have when at the leaf.  For example, for a perfectly balanced tree, $$L = \log N$$ and the time complexity would be $$O(N \log N)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
