#### Approach 1: Schoolbook Addition

**Intuition**

Let's add numbers in a schoolbook way, column by column.  For example, to add 123 and 912, we add 3+2, then 2+1, then 1+9.  Whenever our addition result is more than 10, we carry the 1 into the next column.  The result is 1035.

**Algorithm**

We can do a variant of the above idea that is easier to implement - we put the entire addend in the first column from the right.

Continuing the example of 123 + 912, we start with [1, 2, 3+912].  Then we perform the addition 3+912, leaving 915.  The 5 stays as the digit, while we 'carry' 910 into the next column which becomes 91.

We repeat this process with [1, 2+91, 5].  We have 93, where 3 stays and 90 is carried over as 9.  Again, we have [1+9, 3, 5] which transforms into [1, 0, 3, 5].



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\max(N, \log K))$$ where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(\max(N, \log K))$$.
