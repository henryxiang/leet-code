#### Approach 1: Work Backwards

**Intuition**

Instead of multiplying by 2 or subtracting 1 from `X`, we could divide by 2 (when `Y` is even) or add 1 to `Y`.

The motivation for this is that it turns out we always greedily divide by 2:

* If say `Y` is even, then if we perform 2 additions and one division, we could instead perform one division and one addition for less operations [`(Y+2) / 2` vs `Y/2 + 1`].

* If say `Y` is odd, then if we perform 3 additions and one division, we could instead perform 1 addition, 1 division, and 1 addition for less operations [`(Y+3) / 2` vs `(Y+1) / 2 + 1`].

**Algorithm**

While `Y` is larger than `X`, add 1 if it is odd, else divide by 2.  After, we need to do `X - Y` additions to reach `X`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\log Y)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
