#### Approach 1: Annotate Parent and Depth

**Intuition**

Nodes are cousins if they have the same depth but different parents.  A straightforward approach is to be able to know the parent and depth of each node.

**Algorithm**

We can use a depth-first search to annotate each node.  For each `node` with parent `par` and depth `d`, we will record results in hashmaps: `parent[node.val] = par` and `depth[node.val] = d`.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
