1049. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row | Algorithms | Medium | Array, Greedy

## Solution

---

#### Approach 1: Greedy.

**Intuition**

Let's pick up an arbitrary `i`th domino element in the configuration. 
The element has two sides, `A[i]` is an upper side 
and `B[i]` is a lower side.

There could be three possible situations here

1 . One could make all elements of `A` row or `B` row 
to be the same and equal to `A[i]` value. 
For example, if one picks up the `0`th element, 
it's possible to make all elements of `A` row to be equal to `2`.

2 . One could make all elements of `A` row or `B` row 
to be the same and equal to `B[i]` value. 
For example, if one picks up the `1`th element, 
it's possible to make all elements of `B` row to be equal to `2`.

3 . It's impossible to make all elements of `A` row or `B` row 
to have the same `A[i]` or `B[i]` value.

> The third situation means that it's impossible to make all
elements in `A` row or `B` row to be equal. 

Yes, the only one domino element was checked here, and still it's
enough because the rotation is the only allowed operation here.

**Algorithm**

- Pick up the first element. It has two sides: `A[0]` and `B[0]`.

- Check if one could make all elements in `A` row or `B` row 
to be equal to `A[0]`. 
If yes, return the minimum number of rotations needed.

- Check if one could make all elements in `A` row or `B` row 
to be equal to `B[0]`.
If yes, return the minimum number of rotations needed.

- Otherwise return `-1`.


**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ since here one iterates over the
arrays not more than two times.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since it's a constant 
space solution.
