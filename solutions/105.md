#### How to traverse the tree

There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:

- *Breadth First Search* (`BFS`)

    We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height,
    from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before
    the ones with lower levels.
     
- *Depth First Search* (`DFS`)

    In this strategy, we adopt the `depth` as the priority, so that one
    would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,
    and then back to root to reach another branch.

    The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as
    `preorder`, `inorder`, and `postorder` depending on the relative order
    among the root node, left node and right node.
    
On the following figure the nodes are numerated in the order you visit them,
please follow ```1-2-3-4-5``` to compare different strategies.

Here the problem is to construct a binary tree from its preorder and
inorder traversal.

#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Tree definition**

First of all, here is the definition of the ```TreeNode``` which we would use.


 
**Algorithm**

As discussed above the preorder traversal follows `Root -> Left -> Right` order,
that makes it very convenient to construct the tree from its root.

Let's do it. The first element in the *preorder* list is a root. 
This root splits *inorder* list into left and right subtrees.
Now one have to pop up the root from preorder list since 
it's already used as a tree node and then repeat the step above for the
left and right subtrees.

**Complexity analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$. Let's compute the solution with the help of 
[master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) 
$$T(N) = aT\left(\frac{b}{N}\right) + \Theta(N^d)$$.
The equation represents dividing the problem 
up into $$a$$ subproblems of size $$\frac{N}{b}$$ in $$\Theta(N^d)$$ time. 
Here one divides the problem in two subproblemes `a = 2`, the size of each subproblem 
(to compute left and right subtree) is a half of initial problem `b = 2`, 
and all this happens in a constant time `d = 0`.
That means that $$\log_b(a) > d$$ and hence we're dealing with 
[case 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)#Case_1_example)
that means $$\mathcal{O}(N^{\log_b(a)}) = \mathcal{O}(N)$$ time complexity.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, since we store the entire tree.
