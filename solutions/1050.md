## Solution

#### Approach 1: Construct binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal

**Intuition**

This approach is not the optimal one because of $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$ time complexity,
but very straightforward. 

Let's use here two facts:

- [Binary tree could be constructed from preorder and inorder traversal](https://leetcode.com/articles/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-tr/).

- [Inorder traversal of BST is an array sorted in the ascending order](https://leetcode.com/articles/delete-node-in-a-bst/).

**Algorithm**

- Construct inorder traversal by sorting the preorder array.

- [Construct binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal](https://leetcode.com/articles/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-tr/):
the idea is to peek the elements one by one from the preorder array and
try to put them as a left or as a right child if it's possible. 
If it's impossible - just put `null` as a child and proceed further.
The possibility to use an element as a child is checked by an inorder array: 
if it contains no elements for this subtree, then the element couldn't be used here,
and one should use `null` as a child instead.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$. $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$ to sort preorder array
and $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to construct the binary tree.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ the inorder traversal and the tree.

#### Approach 2: Recursion

**Intuition**

It's quite obvious that the best possible time complexity for this problem 
is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ and hence the approach 1 is not the best one.
 
Basically, the inorder traversal above was used only to check if the element
could be placed in this subtree. 
Since one deals with a BST here, this could be verified with the help of lower and 
upper limits for each element as for the [validate BST problem](https://leetcode.com/articles/validate-binary-search-tree/).
This way there is no need in inorder traversal and the time
complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$.

**Algorithm**

- Initiate the lower and upper limits as negative and positive infinity because
one could always place the root.

- Start from the first element in the preorder array `idx = 0`.

- Return `helper(lower, upper)`:

    - If the preorder array is used up `idx = n` then the tree is
    constructed, return null.
    
    - If current value `val = preorder[idx]` is smaller then lower limit,
    or larger than upper limit, return null.
    
    - If the current value is in the limits, place it here `root = 
    TreeNode(val)`
    and proceed to construct recursively left and right subtrees:
    `root.left = helper(lower, val)` and `root.right = helper(val, upper)`.

    - Return `root`.

**Implementation**

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ since we visit each node exactly once. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep the entire tree.

#### Approach 3: Iteration

**Algorithm**

The recursion above could be converted into the iteration 
with the help of stack.

- Pick the first preorder element as a root `root = new TreeNode(preorder[0])`
and push it into stack.

- Use `for` loop to iterate along the elements of preorder array :

    - Pick the last element of the stack as a parent node, and the 
    the current element of preorder as a child node.
    
    - Adjust the parent node : pop out of stack all elements
    with the value smaller than the child value.
    Change the parent node at each pop `node = stack.pop()`.
    
    - If `node.val < child.val` - put the child as a right 
    child of the node : `node.right = child`.
    
    - Else - as a left child : `node.left = child`.
    
    - Push child node into the stack.
    
- Return `root`.
