#### How to traverse the tree

There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:
     
- *Depth First Search* (`DFS`)

    In this strategy, we adopt the `depth` as the priority, so that one
    would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,
    and then back to root to reach another branch.

    The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as
    `preorder`, `inorder`, and `postorder` depending on the relative order
    among the root node, left node and right node.
    
- *Breadth First Search* (`BFS`)

    We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height,
    from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before
    the ones with lower levels.
    
On the following figure the nodes are enumerated in the order you visit them,
please follow `1-2-3-4-5` to compare different strategies.

#### Approach 1: Recursion

**How to construct the tree from two traversals: inorder and preorder/postorder/etc**

Problems like this one are often at Facebook interviews, and could be solved in
$$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ time:

- Start from not inorder traversal, usually it's preorder or postorder one, and 
use the traversal picture above to define the strategy to pick the nodes. 
For example, for preorder traversal the _first_ value is a root, then
its left child, then its right child, etc. 
For postorder traversal the _last_ value is a root, then its right child,
then its left child, etc. 

- The value picked from preorder/postorder traversal splits the inorder 
traversal into left and right subtrees. The only information one needs from
inorder - if the current subtree is empty (= return `None`) or not 
(= continue to construct the subtree).

**Algorithm**

- Build hashmap `value -> its index` for inorder traversal.

- Return `helper` function which takes as the arguments 
the left and right boundaries for the current subtree in the inorder traversal.
These boundaries are used only to check if the subtree is empty or not.
Here is how it works `helper(in_left = 0, in_right = n - 1)`:

    - If `in_left > in_right`, the subtree is empty, return `None`.
    
    - Pick the last element in postorder traversal as a root.
    
    - Root value has index `index` in the inorder traversal,
    elements from `in_left` to `index - 1` belong to the left subtree,
    and elements from `index + 1` to `in_right` belong to the right subtree.
    
    - Following the postorder logic, proceed recursively first to construct the
    right subtree `helper(index + 1, in_right)` and then to construct 
    the left subtree `helper(in_left, index - 1)`.
    
    - Return `root`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$. Let's compute the solution with the help of 
[master theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)) 
$$T(N) = aT\left(\frac{b}{N}\right) + \Theta(N^d)$$.
The equation represents dividing the problem 
up into $$a$$ subproblems of size $$\frac{N}{b}$$ in $$\Theta(N^d)$$ time. 
Here one divides the problem in two subproblemes `a = 2`, the size of each subproblem 
(to compute left and right subtree) is a half of initial problem `b = 2`, 
and all this happens in a constant time `d = 0`.
That means that $$\log_b(a) > d$$ and hence we're dealing with 
[case 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)#Case_1_example)
that means $$\mathcal{O}(N^{\log_b(a)}) = \mathcal{O}(N)$$ time complexity.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, since we store the entire tree.
