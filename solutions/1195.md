#### Approach 1: Sum of Arithmetic Progression

**Intuition**

That sort of "Math" questions is to check on how far one 
could simplify the problem even before starting to code.

Naive idea here is to jump into code and start to give candies 
in a loop till the end of candies. Time complexity of such a 
solution would be $$\mathcal{O}(\max(G, N))$$, where G is a number of gifts 
and N is a number of people.

More elegant way would be to notice that candies distribution 
could be described by a simple formula. Using that formula 
one could solve the problem in $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ time
by the straightforward generation of final distribution array.

Let's derive that formula step by step.

**Number of persons with complete gifts**

Candies gifts, except the last gift which contains the remaining,
represent the arithmetic progression of natural numbers.

Let's assume that the progression has `p` elements,
then the remaining is just a difference between number of candies $$C$$
and sum of the progression elements

$$
\textrm{remaining} = C - \sum\limits_{k = 0}^{k = p}{k}
$$

Sum of the natural numbers progression is a 
[school knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_%2B_2_%2B_3_%2B_4_%2B_%E2%8B%AF),
and remaining could be rewritten as

$$
\textrm{remaining} = C - \frac{p(p + 1)}{2}
$$

It's known that remaining is larger or equal to 0 and smaller than 
the next progression number $$p + 1$$.

$$
0 \le C - \frac{p(p + 1)}{2} < p + 1
$$

Simple calculations results in 

$$
\sqrt{2C + \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{3}{2} < p \le \sqrt{2C + \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}
$$

There is only one integer in this interval, and hence now
one knows the number of elements in the arithmetic progression

$$
p = \textrm{floor}\left(\sqrt{2C + \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

**Candies gain during the complete turns**

Now one could compute a number of complete turns when all N persons
received a gift : `rows = p / N`. 

During complete turns person number `i` receives in total 

$$
d[i] = i + (i + N) + (i + 2N) + ... (i + (\textrm{rows} - 1) N) = 
i \times \textrm{rows} + N \frac{\textrm{rows}(\textrm{rows} - 1)}{2}
$$

**Candies gain during the incomplete turn**

The last turn could be incomplete, i.e. not all persons receive 
their gifts.

One could compute a number of persons which received a complete
gift : `cols = p % N`. These persons will receive one turn more candies 

$$
d[i] += i + N \times \textrm{rows}
$$

And the last person with a gift will receive all remaining candies

$$
d[\textrm{cols} + 1] += \textrm{remaining}
$$

That's all, all distributed candies are computed.

**Algorithm**

- Compute number of persons with complete gifts

$$
p = \textrm{floor}\left(\sqrt{2C + \frac{1}{4}} - \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

and the last gift $$\textrm{remaining} = C - \frac{p(p + 1)}{2}$$.

- Compute the number of complete turns, when all persons receive their 
gifts : `rows = p // n`, and candies gain from these turns :
$$
d[i] = i \times \textrm{rows} + N \frac{\textrm{rows}(\textrm{rows} - 1)}{2}
$$

- Add one turn more candies to first `p % N` persons participated in 
the last incomplete turn : $$d[i] += i + N \times \textrm{rows}$$.

- Add `remaining` to the person after the first `p % N` persons.

- Return candies distribution `d`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to create N elements 
of the output array.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep the output.
