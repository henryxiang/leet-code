#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition**

First of all, let's simplify the problem and implement a function 
`max_gain(node)`
which takes a node as an argument and computes a maximum contribution
that this node and one/zero of its subtrees could add.  

> In other words, it's a _maximum gain_ one could have including 
the node (and maybe one of its subtrees) into the path.

Hence if one would know for sure that the max path contains `root`, 
the problem would be solved as `max_gain(root)`.
Unfortunately, _the max path does not need to go through the root_, and
here is an example of such a tree

![gains](../Figures/124/124_max_path.png)

That means one needs to modify the above function and to check at
each step what is better : to continue the current path or
to start a new path with the current node as a highest node
in this new path. 

**Algorithm**

Now everything is ready to write down an algorithm.

* Initiate `max_sum` as the smallest possible integer and 
call `max_gain(node = root)`.
* Implement `max_gain(node)` 
with a check to continue the old path/to start a new path:
    * Base case : if node is null, the max gain is `0`.
    * Call `max_gain` recursively for the node children to
    compute max gain from the left and right subtrees :
    `left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0)` and  
    `right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0)`.
    * Now check to continue the old path or to start a new path.
    To start a new path would cost 
    `price_newpath = node.val + left_gain + right_gain`.
    Update `max_sum` if it's better to start a new path.
    * For the recursion return the max gain 
    the node and one/zero of its subtrees could add 
    to the current path : 
    `node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain)`.       

**Tree Node**

Here is the definition of the `TreeNode` which we would use
in the following implementation.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ where `N` is number of nodes,
since we visit each node not more than 2 times.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$$. We have to keep a 
recursion stack of the size of the tree height, which is 
$$\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$$ for the binary tree.
