#### How to traverse the tree


There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:

- *Breadth First Search* (`BFS`)

    We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height,
    from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before
    the ones with lower levels.
     
- *Depth First Search* (`DFS`)

    In this strategy, we adopt the `depth` as the priority, so that one
    would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,
    and then back to root to reach another branch.

    The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as
    `preorder`, `inorder`, and `postorder` depending on the relative order
    among the root node, left node and right node.
    
On the following figure the nodes are numerated in the order you visit them,
please follow ```1-2-3-4-5``` to compare different strategies.

Here the problem is to implement postorder traversal using iterations.

#### Approach 1: Iterations

**Algorithm**

First of all, here is the definition of the ```TreeNode``` which we would use
in the following implementation.



Let's start from the root and then at each iteration 
pop the current node out of the stack and
push its child nodes. 
In the implemented strategy we push nodes into output list 
following the order ```Top->Bottom``` and ```Left->Right```, that
naturally reproduces preorder traversal.





**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : we visit each node exactly once, thus the 
time complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$,
where $$N$$ is the number of nodes, *i.e.* the size of tree.

* Space complexity : depending on the tree structure, 
we could keep up to the entire tree, therefore, the space complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: Morris traversal

This approach is based on [Morris's article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0020019079900681) 
which is intended to optimize the space complexity. The algorithm does not use additional space 
for the computation, and the memory 
is only used to keep the output. 
If one prints the output directly along the computation, the space complexity 
would be $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.

**Algorithm**

Here the idea is to go down from the node to its predecessor, 
and each predecessor will be visited twice.
For this go one step left if possible and then always right till the end.
When we visit a leaf (node's predecessor) first time, it has a zero right child, 
so we update output and establish 
the pseudo link ```predecessor.right = root``` to mark the fact the predecessor is visited.
When we visit the same predecessor the second time, it 
already points to the current node, thus we remove pseudo link and 
move right to the next node.

If the first one step left is impossible, 
update output and move right to next node.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : we visit each predecessor exactly twice descending down 
from the node, thus the time complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$,
where $$N$$ is the number of nodes, *i.e.* the size of tree.

* Space complexity : we use no additional memory for the computation itself, 
but output list contains $$N$$ elements, and thus space complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$.
