#### Approach 1: Ordered dictionary

**Intuition**

We're asked to implement [the structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU) 
which provides the following operations in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time :

- Get the key / Check if the key exists 

- Put the key

- Delete the first added key

The first two operations in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time are provided 
by the standard hashmap, and the last one - by linked list.

> There is a structure called _ordered dictionary_, it combines 
behind both hashmap and linked list. In Python this structure is called
[_OrderedDict_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict)
and in Java [_LinkedHashMap_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedHashMap.html).

Let's use this structure here.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ both for `put`
and `get` since all operations with
ordered dictionary : `get/in/set/move_to_end/popitem` 
(`get/containsKey/put/remove`) are done in a constant time.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(capacity)$$ since the 
space is used only for an ordered dictionary with at most `capacity + 1` elements.

#### Approach 2: Hashmap + DoubleLinkedList

**Intuition**

This Java solution is an extended version of the 
[the article published on the Discuss forum](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/discuss/45911/Java-Hashtable-%2B-Double-linked-list-(with-a-touch-of-pseudo-nodes)).

The problem can be solved with a hashmap
that keeps track of the keys and its values in the double linked list. 
That results in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time for `put` and `get` operations and
allows to remove the first added node in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time as well.

One advantage of _double_ linked list is that the node can remove itself without other reference. 
In addition, it takes constant time to add and remove nodes from the head or tail.

One particularity about the double linked list implemented here
is that there are _pseudo head_ and _pseudo tail_ to mark the boundary, 
so that we don't need to check the `null` node during the update.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ both for `put`
and `get`.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(capacity)$$ since the 
space is used only for a hashmap and double linked list 
with at most `capacity + 1` elements.
