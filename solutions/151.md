#### Overview

Different interviewers would probably expect different approaches for 
this problem. The holy war question is to use or not use built-in methods.
As you may notice, most of design problems on Leetcode are voted down 
because of two main reasons:

1. There was no approach with built-in methods / data structures in the article.

2. One of the approaches in the article did contain built-in methods / data structures.

Seems like the community has no common opinion yet, and 
in practice that means an unpredictable interview experience for some
sort of problems. 
 
Here we consider three different solutions 
of linear time and space complexity:

1. Use built-in split and reverse.
Benefits: in-place in Python (in-place, but linear space complexity!) 
and the simplest one to write.  

2. The most straightforward one. Trim the whitespaces, reverse the
whole string and then reverse each word.  
Benefits: could be done in-place for the languages with mutable strings.

3. Two passes approach with a deque. 
Move along the string, word by word, and 
push each new word in front of the deque. 
Convert the deque back into string.
Benefits: two passes.

#### Approach 1: Built-in Split + Reverse

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, where N is a number of characters
in the input string.

* Space complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, to store the result of split
by spaces.

#### Approach 2: Reverse the Whole String and Then Reverse Each Word

The implementation of this approach will be different for 
Java/Python (= immutable strings) and C++ (= mutable strings). 

In the case of immutable strings one has first to convert string into
mutable data structure, and hence it makes sense to trim all spaces during
that conversion.

In the case of _mutable_ strings, there is no need to allocate 
an additional data structure, one could make all job done in-place.
In such a case it makes sense to reverse words and trim spaces at the 
same time.
