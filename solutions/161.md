#### Approach 1: One pass algorithm

**Intuition**

First of all, let's ensure that the string lengths are not too far from each 
other. If the length difference is 2 or more characters, then `s` and `t` couldn't be 
one edit away strings.

For the next let's assume that `s` is always shorter or the same length as `t`.
If not, one could always call `isOneEditDistance(t, s)` to inverse the string order.

Now it's time to pass along the strings and to look for the first different character.

If there is no differences between the first `len(s)` characters, 
only two situations are possible :

- The strings are equal.

- The strings are one edit away distance.

Now what if there _is_ a different character so that `s[i] != t[i]`. 

- If the strings are of the same length, _all_ next 
characters should be equal to keep one edit away distance. To verify it,
one has to compare the substrings of `s` and `t` 
both starting from the `i + 1`th character. 

- If `t` is one character longer than `s`, 
the additional character `t[i]` should be the only difference
between both strings. To verify it, one has to compare
a substring of `s` starting from the `i`th character and 
a substring of `t` starting from the `i + 1`th character.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ in the worst case when
string lengths are close enough `abs(ns - nt) <= 1`, 
where `N` is a number of characters in the longest string. 
$$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ in the best case when `abs(ns - nt) > 1`.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ because strings are immutable
in Python and Java and to create substring costs $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ space.
