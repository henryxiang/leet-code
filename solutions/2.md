#### Approach 1: Elementary Math

**Intuition**

Keep track of the carry using a variable and simulate digits-by-digits sum starting from the head of list, which contains the least-significant digit.

**Algorithm**

Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, which is the head of $$l1$$ and $$l2$$. Since each digit is in the range of $$0 \ldots 9$$, summing two digits may "overflow". For example $$5 + 7 = 12$$. In this case, we set the current digit to $$2$$ and bring over the $$carry = 1$$ to the next iteration. $$carry$$ must be either $$0$$ or $$1$$ because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is $$9 + 9 + 1 = 19$$.

The pseudocode is as following:

* Initialize current node to dummy head of the returning list.
* Initialize carry to $$0$$.
* Initialize $$p$$ and $$q$$ to head of $$l1$$ and $$l2$$ respectively.
* Loop through lists $$l1$$ and $$l2$$ until you reach both ends.
    * Set $$x$$ to node $$p$$'s value. If $$p$$ has reached the end of $$l1$$, set to $$0$$.
    * Set $$y$$ to node $$q$$'s value. If $$q$$ has reached the end of $$l2$$, set to $$0$$.
    * Set $$sum = x + y + carry$$.
    * Update $$carry = sum / 10$$.
    * Create a new node with the digit value of $$(sum \bmod 10)$$ and set it to current node's next, then advance current node to next.
    * Advance both $$p$$ and $$q$$.
* Check if $$carry = 1$$, if so append a new node with digit $$1$$ to the returning list.
* Return dummy head's next node.

Note that we use a dummy head to simplify the code. Without a dummy head, you would have to write extra conditional statements to initialize the head's value.

Take extra caution of the following cases:

| Test case | Explanation |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| $$l1=[0,1]$$$$l2=[0,1,2]$$ | When one list is longer than the other. |
| $$l1=[]$$$$l2=[0,1]$$ | When one list is null, which means an empty list. |
| $$l1=[9,9]$$$$l2=[1]$$ | The sum could have an extra carry of one at the end, which is easy to forget. |



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(\max(m, n))$$. Assume that $$m$$ and $$n$$ represents the length of $$l1$$ and $$l2$$ respectively, the algorithm above iterates at most $$\max(m, n)$$ times.

* Space complexity : $$O(\max(m, n))$$. The length of the new list is at most $$\max(m,n) + 1$$.

**Follow up**

What if the the digits in the linked list are stored in non-reversed order? For example:

$$
(3 \to 4 \to 2) + (4 \to 6 \to 5) = 8 \to 0 \to 7
$$
