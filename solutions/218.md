## Solution

#### Approach 1: Divide and Conquer 

**Solution template**

The problem is a classical example of divide and conquer 
approach, and typically implemented exactly the same way as 
merge sort algorithm.

Let's follow here a solution template for divide and conquer
problems :

- Define the base case(s).

- Split the problem into subproblems and solve them recursively.

- Merge the subproblems solutions into the problem solution.

**Algorithm**

getSkyline for `n` buildings :

- If `n == 0` : return an empty list.

- If `n == 1` : return the skyline for one building (it's straightforward).

- `leftSkyline` = getSkyline for the first n/2 buildings.

- `rightSkyline` = getSkyline for the last n/2 buildings.

- Merge `leftSkyline` and `rightSkyline`.

Now let's discuss each step in more details.

**Base cases**

The first base case is an empty `buildings` list.
Then the skyline is an empty list, too.

The second base case is the only one building in the list, when 
the skyline construction is quite straightforward.

**How to split the problem**

The idea is the same as for merge sort : at each step 
split the list exactly in two parts : from `0` to `n/2` and
 from `n/2` to `n`, and then construct 
the skylines recursively for each part.

**How to merge two skylines**

The algorithm for merge function is quite straightforward 
and based on the same merge sort logic : the height of an output skyline is 
always a maximum between the left and right skylines.

Let's use here two
pointers `pR` and `pL` to track the current element index in both 
skylines, and three integers `leftY`, `rightY`, and `currY` to track the current height
for the `left` skyline, `right` skyline and the merged skyline.

mergeSkylines (left, right) :

- currY = leftY = rightY = 0

- While we're in the region where both skylines are present 
(`pR < nR` and `pL < nL`) :
    
    - Pick up the element with the smallest `x` coordinate. If it's 
    an element from the left skyline, move `pL` and update `leftY`.
    If it's 
    an element from the right skyline, move `pR` and update `rightY`.

    - Compute the largest height at the current point :
    `maxY = max(leftY, rightY)`.
    
    - Update an output skyline by `(x, maxY)` point, if `maxY` is not equal to `currY`.
    
- While there are still elements in the left skyline (`pL < nL`), 
process them following the same logic as above.

- While there are still elements in the right skyline (`pR < nR`), 
process them following the same logic as above.

- Return output skyline.

**Implementation**



* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is number of
buildings. The problem is an example of 
[Master Theorem case II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)#Case_2_example)
 : $$T(N) = 2 T(\frac{N}{2}) + 2N$$, that results in $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$
 time complexity.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep the output.
