#### How to traverse the tree

There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:
     
- *Depth First Search* (`DFS`)

    In this strategy, we adopt the `depth` as the priority, so that one
    would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf,
    and then back to root to reach another branch.

    The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as
    `preorder`, `inorder`, and `postorder` depending on the relative order
    among the root node, left node and right node.
    
- *Breadth First Search* (`BFS`)

    We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height,
    from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before
    the ones with lower levels.
    
On the following figure the nodes are numerated in the order you visit them,
please follow `1-2-3-4-5` to compare different strategies.

> To solve the problem, one could use the property of BST : inorder traversal of BST
is an array sorted in the ascending order.

#### Approach 1: Recursion

It's a very straightforward approach with $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ 
time complexity.
The idea is to build an inorder traversal of BST which is 
an array sorted in the ascending order. 
Now the answer is the `k - 1`th element of this array.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to build a traversal. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep an inorder traversal.




---
#### Approach 2: Iteration

The above recursion could be converted into iteration, 
with the help of stack. This way one could speed up the solution 
because there is no need to build the entire inorder traversal,
and one could stop after the kth element.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(H + k)$$, where $$H$$ is a tree height.
This complexity is defined by the stack, which contains at least $$H + k$$ elements, since before
starting to pop out one has to go down to a leaf. This results in 
$$\mathcal{O}(\log N + k)$$ for the balanced tree and 
$$\mathcal{O}(N + k)$$ for completely unbalanced tree with all
 the nodes in the left subtree. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(H + k)$$, the same as for time complexity, 
$$\mathcal{O}(N + k)$$ in the worst case,
 and $$\mathcal{O}(\log N + k)$$ in the average case.

#### Follow up

> What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) 
often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? 
How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

[Insert](https://leetcode.com/articles/insert-into-a-bst/) 
and [delete](https://leetcode.com/articles/delete-node-in-a-bst/) 
in a BST were discussed last week, the time complexity of these 
operations is $$\mathcal{O}(H)$$, where $$H$$ is a height of binary tree,
and $$H = \log N$$ for the balanced tree.

Hence without any optimisation insert/delete + search of kth element has 
$$\mathcal{O}(2H + k)$$ complexity. 
How to optimise that? 

That's a design question, 
basically we're asked to implement a structure 
which contains a BST inside and
optimises the following operations :

- Insert

- Delete

- Find kth smallest

Seems like a database description, isn't it? 
Let's use here the same logic as for [LRU cache](https://leetcode.com/articles/lru-cache/)
design, and combine an indexing structure (we could keep BST here)
with a double linked list. 

Such a structure would provide:

- $$\mathcal{O}(H)$$ time for the insert and delete.

- $$\mathcal{O}(k)$$ for the search of kth smallest.

The overall time complexity for insert/delete + search of kth smallest
is $$\mathcal{O}(H + k)$$ instead of $$\mathcal{O}(2H + k)$$. 

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity for insert/delete + search of kth smallest: 
$$\mathcal{O}(H + k)$$, where $$H$$ is a tree height.
$$\mathcal{O}(\log N + k)$$ in the average case,
$$\mathcal{O}(N + k)$$ in the worst case.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep the linked list.
