## Solution

#### Overview

We're not going to discuss here an obvious $$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$$
time solution



Instead, the problem will be solved in $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ time
with the help of bitwise operators. The idea 
is to discuss such bitwise tricks as 

- How to get / isolate the rightmost 1-bit : `x & (-x)`.

- How to turn off (= set to 0) the rightmost 1-bit : `x & (x - 1)`.

These tricks are often used as something obvious in more 
complex bit-manipulation solutions, 
like for [N Queens problem](https://leetcode.com/articles/n-queens-ii/),
and it's important to recognize them to understand what is going on.

#### Intuition

The idea behind both solutions will be the same: a power of two
in binary representation is one 1-bit, followed by some zeros:

$$1 = (0000 0001)_2$$

$$2 = (0000 0010)_2$$

$$4 = (0000 0100)_2$$

$$8 = (0000 1000)_2$$

A number which is not a power of two, has more than one 1-bit
in its binary representation:

$$3 = (0000 0011)_2$$

$$5 = (0000 0101)_2$$

$$6 = (0000 0110)_2$$

$$7 = (0000 0111)_2$$

The only exception is 0, which should be treated separately.

#### Approach 1: Bitwise Operators : Get the Rightmost 1-bit

**Get/Isolate the Rightmost 1-bit**

Let's first discuss why `x & (-x)` is a way 
to keep the rightmost 1-bit and to set all the other bits to 0.

Basically, that works because of [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). 
In two's complement notation $$-x$$ is the same as $$\lnot x + 1$$.
In other words, to compute $$-x$$ one has to revert all bits in $$x$$
and then to add 1 to the result.

Adding 1 to $$\lnot x$$ in binary representation means 
to carry that 1-bit till the rightmost 0-bit in $$\lnot x$$
and to set all the lower bits to zero. 
Note, that the rightmost 0-bit in $$\lnot x$$ corresponds to the
rightmost 1-bit in $$x$$. 

> In summary, $$-x$$ is the same as $$\lnot x + 1$$. 
This operation reverts all bits of x except the rightmost 1-bit.

Hence, x and -x have just one bit in common - the rightmost 1-bit.
That means that `x & (-x)` would keep that rightmost 1-bit and 
set all the other bits to 0.

**Detect Power of Two**

So let's do `x & (-x)` to keep the rightmost 1-bit and to set
all the others bits to zero. 
As discussed above, 
for the power of two it would result in `x` itself, since
a power of two contains just one 1-bit.

Other numbers have more than 1-bit in their binary 
representation and hence for them `x & (-x)` would not be
equal to `x` itself. 

Hence a number is a power of two if `x & (-x) == x`.

#### Approach 2: Bitwise operators : Turn off the Rightmost 1-bit

**Turn off the Rightmost 1-bit**

Let's first discuss why `x & (x - 1)` is a way 
to set the rightmost 1-bit to zero.

To subtract 1 means to change the rightmost 1-bit to 0 
and to set all the lower bits to 1.  

Now AND operator: the rightmost 1-bit will be turned off
because `1 & 0 = 0`, 
and all the lower bits as well.

**Detect Power of Two**

The solution is straightforward: 

1. Power of two has just one 1-bit.

2. `x & (x - 1)` sets this 1-bit to zero, 
and hence one has to verify if the result is zero 
`x & (x - 1) == 0`.
