## Solution

#### Approach 1: Two Pointers

**Algorithm**

Since the array is already sorted, we can keep two pointers $$i$$ and $$j$$, where $$i$$ is the slow-runner while $$j$$ is the fast-runner. As long as $$nums[i] = nums[j]$$, we increment $$j$$ to skip the duplicate.

When we encounter $$nums[j] \neq nums[i]$$, the duplicate run has ended so we must copy its value to $$nums[i + 1]$$. $$i$$ is then incremented and we repeat the same process again until $$j$$ reaches the end of array.



**Complexity analysis**

* Time complextiy : $$O(n)$$.
Assume that $$n$$ is the length of array. Each of $$i$$ and $$j$$ traverses at most $$n$$ steps.

* Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.
