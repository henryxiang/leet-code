## Solution

--- 

#### Approach 1: Non-ASCII Delimiter

**Intuition**

Naive solution here is to join strings using delimiters.

> What to use as a delimiter? Each string may contain 
any possible characters out of 256 valid ascii characters.

Seems like one has to use non-ASCII unichar character, 
for example `unichr(257)` in Python and
`Character.toString((char)257)` in Java (it's character `ā`).

Here it's convenient to use two different non-ASCII characters,
to distinguish between situations of "empty array" and 
of "array of empty strings". 

**Implementation**

Use `split` in Java with a second argument `-1` to 
make it work as `split` in Python.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ both for encode and decode,
where N is a number of strings in the input array.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ for encode to keep the output,
since the output is one string.
$$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ for decode keep the output,
since the output is an array of strings.

#### Approach 2: Chunked Transfer Encoding

Pay attention to this approach because last year Google likes
to ask that sort of low-level optimisation. 
[Serialize and deserialize BST problem](https://leetcode.com/articles/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/)
is a similar example. 

This approach is based on the 
[encoding used in HTTP v1.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding).
It doesn't depend on the set of input characters, and hence
is more versatile and effective than Approach 1.

> Data stream is divided into chunks.
Each chunk is preceded by its size in bytes.

**Encoding Algorithm**

![fig](../Figures/271/encodin.png)

- Iterate over the array of chunks, i.e. strings. 

    - For each chunk compute its length, and convert that length into
    4-bytes string.
    
    - Append to encoded string :
     
        - 4-bytes string with information about chunk size in bytes.
        
        - Chunk itself.
        
- Return encoded string.

**Decoding Algorithm**

![fig](../Figures/271/decodin.png)

- Iterate over the encoded string with a pointer `i` initiated as 0.
While `i < n`:

    - Read 4 bytes `s[i: i + 4]`. It's chunk size in bytes. 
    Convert this 4-bytes string to integer `length`.
    
    - Move the pointer by 4 bytes `i += 4`.
    
    - Append to the decoded array string `s[i: i + length]`.
    
    - Move the pointer by `length` bytes `i += length`.
    
- Return decoded array of strings.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ both for encode and decode,
where N is a number of strings in the input array.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ for encode to keep the output,
since the output is one string.
$$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ for decode keep the output,
since the output is an array of strings.
