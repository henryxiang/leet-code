273. Integer to English Words | Algorithms | Hard | Math, String

[TOC]

## Solution

---

#### Approach 1: Divide and conquer 

Let's simplify the problem by representing it as a set of simple sub-problems.
One could split the initial integer `1234567890` on the groups 
containing not more than three digits `1.234.567.890`.
That results in representation `1 Billion 234 Million 567 Thousand 890` and 
reduces the initial problem to how to convert 3-digit integer to English word. 
One could split further `234` -> `2 Hundred 34` into two sub-problems :
convert 1-digit integer and convert 2-digit integer. The first one is trivial. 
The second one could be reduced to the first one for all 2-digit integers 
but the ones from `10` to `19` which should be considered separately.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity :  $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$. 
Intuitively the output is proportional
to the number `N` of digits in the input. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since the output is just a string.
