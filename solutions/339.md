## Summary

This is a very simple recursion problem and is a nice introduction to Depth-first Search (DFS).

## Solution

#### Depth-first Traversal [Accepted]

**Algorithm**

Because the input is nested, it is natural to think about the problem in a recursive way. We go through the list of nested integers one by one, keeping track of the current depth $$d$$. If a nested integer is an integer $$n$$, we calculate its sum as $$n\times d$$. If the nested integer is a list, we calculate the sum of this list recursively using the same process but with depth $$d+1$$.

**Java**

```java
/**
 * // This is the interface that allows for creating nested lists.
 * // You should not implement it, or speculate about its implementation
 * public interface NestedInteger {
 *
 *     // @return true if this NestedInteger holds a single integer,
 *     // rather than a nested list.
 *     public boolean isInteger();
 *
 *     // @return the single integer that this NestedInteger holds,
 *     // if it holds a single integer
 *     // Return null if this NestedInteger holds a nested list
 *     public Integer getInteger();
 *
 *     // @return the nested list that this NestedInteger holds,
 *     // if it holds a nested list
 *     // Return null if this NestedInteger holds a single integer
 *     public List getList();
 * }
 */
public int depthSum(List nestedList) {
    return depthSum(nestedList, 1);
}

public int depthSum(List list, int depth) {
    int sum = 0;
    for (NestedInteger n : list) {
        if (n.isInteger()) {
            sum += n.getInteger() * depth;
        } else {
            sum += depthSum(n.getList(), depth + 1);
        }
    }
    return sum;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

The algorithm takes $$O(N)$$ time, where $$N$$ is the total number of nested elements in the input list. For example, the list `````[ [[[[1]]]], 2 ]````` contains $$4$$ nested lists and $$2$$ nested integers ($$1$$ and $$2$$), so $$N=6$$.

In terms of space, at most $$O(D)$$ recursive calls are placed on the stack, where $$D$$ is the maximum level of nesting in the input. For example, $$D=2$$ for the input `````[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`````, and $$D=3$$ for the input `````[1,[4,[6]]]`````.
