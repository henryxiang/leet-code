#### Overview

_Life is short, use Python._ (c) 



Speaking seriously, let's use this problem to discuss two things:

- Does _in-place_ mean constant space complexity?

- Two pointers approach.

#### Approach 1: Recursion, In-Place, $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ Space

**Does _in-place_ mean constant space complexity?**

No. [By definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), 
an in-place algorithm is an algorithm 
which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. 

The tricky part is that space is used by many actors, not only by 
data structures. The classical example is to use recursive function without
any auxiliary data structures. 

Is it in-place? Yes. 

Is it constant space? No, because of recursion stack.

**Algorithm**

Here is an example. Let's implement recursive function `helper` which 
receives two pointers, left and right, as arguments. 

- Base case: if `left >= right`, do nothing.

- Otherwise, swap `s[left]` and `s[right]` and call `helper(left + 1, right - 1)`.

To solve the problem, call helper function passing the head and tail indexes as 
arguments: `return helper(0, len(s) - 1)`.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ time to perform $$N/2$$ swaps. 

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to keep the recursion stack.

#### Approach 2: Two Pointers, Iteration, $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ Space

**Two Pointers Approach**

In this approach, two pointers are used to process two array elements
at the same time. Usual implementation is to set one pointer in the 
beginning and one at the end and then to move them until they both meet.  

Sometimes one needs to generalize this approach in order to use three pointers, 
like for classical [Sort Colors problem](https://leetcode.com/articles/sort-colors/).

**Algorithm**

- Set pointer left at index 0, and pointer right at index `n - 1`,
where n is a number of elements in the array.

- While left < right:

    - Swap `s[left]` and `s[right]`.
    
    - Move left pointer one step right, and right pointer one step left.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ to swap $$N/2$$ element. 

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$, it's a constant space solution.
