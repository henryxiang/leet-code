#### Approach #1: Greedy [Accepted]

**Intuition**

A palindrome consists of letters with equal partners, plus possibly a unique center (without a partner).  The letter `i` from the left has its partner `i` from the right.  For example in `'abcba'`, `'aa'` and `'bb'` are partners, and `'c'` is a unique center.

Imagine we built our palindrome.  It consists of as many partnered letters as possible, plus a unique center if possible.  This motivates a greedy approach.

**Algorithm**

For each letter, say it occurs `v` times.  We know we have `v // 2 * 2` letters that can be partnered for sure.  For example, if we have `'aaaaa'`, then we could have `'aaaa'` partnered, which is `5 // 2 * 2 = 4` letters partnered.

At the end, if there was any `v % 2 == 1`, then that letter could have been a unique center.  Otherwise, every letter was partnered.  To perform this check, we will check for `v % 2 == 1` and `ans % 2 == 0`, the latter meaning we haven't yet added a unique center to the answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `s`.  We need to count each letter.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$, the space for our count, as the alphabet size of `s` is fixed.  We should also consider that in a bit complexity model, technically we need $$O(\log N)$$ bits to store the count values.
