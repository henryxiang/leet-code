## Solution

#### Approach 1: Index as a hash key.

**Data clean up**

First of all let's get rid of negative numbers and zeros since there is no
need of them. One could get rid of all numbers larger than `n` as well,
since the first missing positive is for sure smaller or equal to `n + 1`.
The case when the first missing positive is equal to `n + 1` will be
treated separately.

What does it mean - to get rid of, if one has to keep $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$
time complexity and hence could not pop unwanted elements out? 
Let's just replace all these by `1`s.

To ensure that the first missing positive is not `1`, one has to verify 
the presence of `1` before proceeding to this operation.

**How to solve in-place**

Now there we have an array which contains only positive numbers
in a range from `1` to `n`,
and the problem is to find a first missing positive in 
$$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ time and constant space. 

That would be simple, if one would be allowed to 
have a hash-map `positive number -> its presence` for the array.

Sort of "dirty workaround" solution would be to allocate a string `hash_str` 
with `n` zeros, and use it as a sort of hash map by changing 
`hash_str[i]` to `1` each time one meets number `i` in the array.

Let's not use this solution, but just take away a pretty nice idea _to use 
index as a hash-key_ for a positive number.

The final idea is to _use index in nums as a hash key_ and _sign of 
the element as a hash value_ which is presence detector.

> For example, negative sign of `nums[2]` element means that 
number `2` is present in `nums`. The positive sign of `nums[3]` element
means that number `3` is not present (missing) in `nums`.

To achieve that let's walk along the array (which after clean up contains 
only positive numbers), check each element value `elem` 
and change the sign of element `nums[elem]` to negative to mark 
that number `elem` is present in `nums`. Be careful 
with duplicates and ensure that the sign was changed only once.

**Algorithm**

Now everything is ready to write down the algorithm.

* Check if `1` is present in the array. If not, you're done and `1`
is the answer.
* If `nums = [1]`, the answer is `2`.
* Replace negative numbers, zeros, and numbers larger than `n` by `1`s.
* Walk along the array. Change the sign of a-th element if you meet number `a`. 
Be careful with duplicates : do sign change only once.
Use index `0` to save an information about presence of number `n` since 
index `n` is not available.
* Walk again along the array. Return the index of the first positive element.
* If `nums[0] > 0` return `n`.
* If on the previous step you didn't find the positive element in nums, that means
that the answer is `n + 1`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ since all we do here is four walks 
along the array of length `N`.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since this is a constant space solution.
