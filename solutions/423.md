#### Approach 1: Hashmap

**Intuition**

The naive approach would be to construct as many `"zero"`s 
as it's possible from letters available in the input string, 
then as many `"one"`s as it's possible, etc. 
The problem is that letters `"o"`, `"n"`, `"e"` could be present
as well in the another numbers that means that 
the straightforward approach could be misleading.

Hence the idea is to look for something unique. One could notice
that all even numbers contain each a unique letter :

* Letter "z" is present only in "zero".
* Letter "w" is present only in "two".
* Letter "u" is present only in "four".
* Letter "x" is present only in "six".
* Letter "g" is present only in "eight".

> Hence there is a good way to count even numbers.

That is actually the key how to count `3`s, `5`s and `7`s since
some letters are present only in one odd and one even number
(and all even numbers has already been counted) :

* Letter "h" is present only in "three" and "eight".
* Letter "f" is present only in "five" and "four".
* Letter "s" is present only in "seven" and "six".

Now one needs to count `9`s and `0`s only, and the logic is
basically the same :

* Letter "i" is present in "nine", "five", "six", and "eight".
* Letter "n" is present in "one", "seven", and "nine".

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ where `N`
is a number of characters in the input string. 
$$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ time is needed to compute hashmap `count`
"letter -> its frequency in the input string". Then we deal with 
a data structure `out` which contains `10` elements only and 
all operations are done in a constant time.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.
`count` contains constant number of elements since 
input string contains only lowercase English letters, and
`out` contains not more than `10` elements.
