#### Approach 1: Recursion with memorisation

**Intuition**

The first idea here is a recursion. That's a straightforward
approach but quite time consuming because of huge recursion depth for long input strings.

- If the strings are equal `p == s`, return `True`.

- If the pattern matches whatever string `p == '*'`, return `True`.

- If `p` is empty, or `s` is empty, return False.

- If the current characters match `p[0] == s[0]` or `p[0] == '?'`, 
then compare the next ones and return `isMatch(s[1:], p[1:])`.

- If the current pattern character is a star `p[0] == '*'`, then
there are two possible situations:

    - The star matches no characters, and hence the answer is
    `isMatch(s, p[1:])`.
    
    - The star matches one or more characters, and so the answer is
    `isMatch(s[1:], p)`.
    
- If `p[0] != s[0]`, return `False`.

The problem of this algorithm is that it doesn't pass 
all test cases because of time limit issue, 
and hence has to be optimised.
Here is what could be done:

1. _Memorisation_. That is a standard way to optimise the recursion. 
Let's have a memorisation hashmap using pair `(s, p)` as a key and
match/doesn't match as a boolean value. 
One could keep all already checked pairs `(s, p)` in this hashmap, so that
if there are any duplicate checks, the answer is right here, 
and there is no need to proceed to the computations again.

2. _Clean up of the input data_. Whether the patterns with multiple stars 
in a row `a****bc**cc` are valid wildcards or not, they could be 
simplified without any data loss `a*bc*cc`. Such a cleanup helps to decrease
the recursion depth. 

**Algorithm**

Here is the algorithm.

- Clean up the input by replacing more than one star in a row by a single star: 
`p = remove_duplicate_stars(p)`.

- Initiate the memorisation hashmap `dp`.

- Return the helper function with a cleaned input: `helper(s, p)`.

- `helper(s, p)`:

    - If (s, p) is already known and stored in dp, return the value.

    - If the strings are equal `p == s`, or the pattern matches whatever string `p == '*'`,
    add `dp[(s, p)] = True`.
    
    - Else if `p` is empty, or `s` is empty, add `dp[(s, p)] = False`.
    
    - Else if the current characters match `p[0] == s[0]` or `p[0] == '?'`, 
    then compare the next ones and add `dp[(s, p)] = helper(s[1:], p[1:])`.
    
    - Else if the current pattern character is a star `p[0] == '*'`, then
    there are two possible situations: the star matches no characters,
    and the star matches one or more characters. 
    `dp[(s, p)] = helper(s, p[1:]) or helper(s, p[1:])`.
        
    - Else `p[0] != s[0]`, add `dp[(s, p)] = False`.
    
    - Now that the value is computed, return it `dp[(s, p)]`.

**Implementation**   



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(\min(S, P))$$ for the best case, 
and $$\mathcal{O}(2^{\min(S, P/2)})$$ for the worst case, where S and P are lengths of 
the input string and the pattern correspondingly. The best case is quite obvious, 
let's estimate the worst case. The most time consuming is the situation where 
recursion forms the tree on the star character in the pattern. 
In this situation 2 branches are executed : `helper(s, p[1:])` and `helper(s[1:], p)`. 
The maximum number of stars in the pattern after data cleanup is $$P/2$$ and hence
the time complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(2^{\min(S, P/2)})$$.
* Space complexity: $$\mathcal{O}(2^{\min(S, P/2)})$$ to keep the memorisation hashmap and
the recursion stack.

#### Approach 2: Dynamic Programming 

**Intuition**

Recursion approach above shows how painful the large recursion depth could be,
so let's try something more iterative. 

Memorisation from the first approach gives an idea to try a dynamic programming.
The problem is very similar with [Edit Distance problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/solution/),
so let's use exactly the same approach here.

The idea would be to reduce the problem to simple ones. 
For example, there is a string `adcebdk` and pattern `*a*b?k`,
and we want to compute if there is a match for them: `D = True/False`. 
One could notice that it seems to be more simple for short strings and patterns 
and so it would be logical to relate a match `D[p_len][s_len]` with the lengths `p_len` 
and `s_len` of input pattern and string correspondingly.

Let's go further and introduce a match `D[p_idx][s_idx]` 
which is a match between the first `p_idx` characters of the pattern 
and the first `s_idx` characters of the string.

![bla](../Figures/44/dp_match2.png)

It turns out that one could compute `D[p_idx][s_idx]`, knowing 
a match without the last characters `D[p_idx - 1][s_idx - 1]`.

> If the last characters are the same or pattern character is '?', then 

$$
D[p_{idx}][s_{idx}] = D[p_{idx} - 1][s_{idx} - 1] \qquad (1)
$$

![bla](../Figures/44/word_match3.png)

> If the pattern character is '*' and there was a match on the previous step
`D[p_idx - 1][s_idx - 1] = True`, then 

- The star at the end of pattern still results in a match. 

- The star could much as many characters as you wish.

$$
D[p_{idx} - 1][i] = \textrm{True}, i \ge s_{idx} - 1 \qquad(2)
$$

So each step of the computation would be done based on the previous ones,
as follows: 

![bla](../Figures/44/if_match.png)

![bla](../Figures/44/dpstar.png)

**Algorithm**

- Start from the table initiated as `False` everywhere but `D[0][0] = True`.

- Apply rules (1) and (2) in a loop and return `D[p_len][s_len]` as an answer.

![bla](../Figures/44/fixed.png)

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(S P)$$ where S and P are lengths of 
the input string and the pattern correspondingly. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(S P)$$ to keep the matrix.

#### Approach 3: Backtracking

**Intuition**

Complexity $$\mathcal{O}(S P)$$ is much better than $$\mathcal{O}(2^{\min(S, P/2)})$$,
but still could be improved. There is no need to compute the entire matrix,
and i.e. to check all the possibilities for each star :

- Star matches zero characters.
- Star matches one character.
- Star matches two characters. 

...

- Star matches all remaining characters.  

Let's just pick up the first opportunity "matches zero characters" and proceed further.
If this assumption would lead in "no match" situation, then _backtrack_ : come back
to the previous star, assume now that it matches one more character (one) and 
proceed again. Again "no match" situation? 
_Backtrack again_ : come back to the previous star, 
and assume now that it matches one more character (two), etc. 

![bla](../Figures/44/backtrack.png)

**Algorithm**

Here is the algorithm.

- Let's use two pointers here: `s_idx` to iterate over the string, and `p_idx` to 
iterate over the pattern. While `s_idx < s_len`:

    - If there are still characters in the pattern `p_idx < p_len` and
    the characters under the pointers match 
    `p[p_idx] == s[s_idx]` or `p[p_idx] == '?'`,
    then move forward by increasing both pointers.
    
    - Else if there are still characters in the pattern `p_idx < p_len`, and
    `p[p_idx] == '*'`, then first check "match zero characters" situation, i.e.
    increase only pattern pointer `p_idx++`.
    Write down for a possible backtrack the star position in `star_idx` variable,
    and the current string pointer in `s_tmp_idx` variable.
    
    - Else if there is "no match" situation: 
    the pattern is used up `p_idx < p_len`
    or the characters under the pointers doesn't match. 
    
        - If there was no stars in the pattern, i.e. no `star_idx`, return `False`.
        
        - If there was a star, then backtrack: set pattern pointer
        just after the last star `p_idx = star_idx + 1`, and string 
        pointer `s_idx = s_tmp_idx + 1`, i.e. assume that this time the star
        matches _one more character_. Save the current string pointer 
        for the possible backtrack `s_tmp_idx = s_idx`.
        
- Return `True` if all remaining characters in the pattern are stars. 

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\min(S, P))$$ for the best case and
better than $$\mathcal{O}(S \log P)$$ for the average case, where S and P are lengths of 
the input string and the pattern correspondingly. 
Please refer to [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.0950.pdf) for the detailed proof. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since it's a constant space solution.
