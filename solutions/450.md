#### Three facts to know about BST

Here is list of facts which are better to know before the interview.

> Inorder traversal of BST is an array sorted in the ascending order.

To compute inorder traversal follow the direction `Left -> Node -> Right`.

> Successor = "after node", i.e. the next node, or the smallest node _after_ the current one.  

It's also the _next_ node in the inorder traversal. To find a successor, go to the right once
and then as many times to the left as you could.



> Predecessor = "before node", i.e. the previous node, or the largest node _before_ the current one.  

It's also the _previous_ node in the inorder traversal. To find a predecessor, go to the left once
and then as many times to the right as you could.

#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition**

There are three possible situations here :

- Node is a leaf, and one could delete it straightforward : `node = null`.

- Node is not a leaf and has a right child. Then the node could be replaced by its
_successor_ which is somewhere lower in the right subtree. Then one could proceed down recursively to
delete the successor.

- Node is not a leaf, has no right child and has a left child. That means that its _successor_ is somewhere
 upper in the tree but we don't want to go back.
 Let's use the _predecessor_ here which is somewhere lower in the left subtree.
 The node could be replaced by its
_predecessor_ and then one could proceed down recursively to delete the predecessor.

**Algorithm**

- If `key > root.val` then delete the node to delete is in the right subtree
`root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)`.

- If `key < root.val` then delete the node to delete is in the left subtree
`root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)`.  

- If `key == root.val` then the node to delete is right here. Let's do it :

    - If the node is a leaf, the delete process is straightforward :
    `root = null`.
    
    - If the node is not a leaf and has the right child, then replace the node 
    value by a successor value `root.val = successor.val`, 
    and then recursively delete
    the successor in the right subtree `root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.val)`.
    
    - If the node is not a leaf and has only the left child, then replace the node 
    value by a predecessor value `root.val = predecessor.val`, and then recursively delete
    the predecessor in the left subtree `root.left = deleteNode(root.left, root.val)`.
    
- Return `root`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$$. During the algorithm 
execution we go down the tree
all the time - on the left or on the right, 
first to search the node to delete ($$\mathcal{O}(H_1)$$ time
complexity as already 
[discussed](https://leetcode.com/articles/insert-into-a-bst/)) 
and then to actually delete it. $$H_1$$ is a tree height from the root to the node 
to delete.
Delete process takes $$\mathcal{O}(H_2)$$ time, where $$H_2$$ is a tree height
from the root to delete to the leafs.
That in total results in $$\mathcal{O}(H_1 + H_2) = \mathcal{O}(H)$$ time
complexity, where $$H$$ is a tree height, equal to $$\log N$$ in the case of the balanced tree.    
    
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(H)$$ to keep the recursion stack, where $$H$$ is a tree
height. $$H = \log N$$ for the balanced tree.
