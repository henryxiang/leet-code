#### Approach 1: Pig as a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) 

**Intuition**

These "strange" questions are now asked by Google, Baidu and IBM 
because of their interest in quantum computing. 
[Quantum bit]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit)) 
(or _qubit_) is the basic unit of quantum information, it's 
the quantum version of the classical binary bit.
Binary bit has only two states : `0` and `1`, 
and on a very basic level the qubit has more. 
In such questions we deal with an object (here is a pig) which has more than two states.

**How many states does a pig have**

If there is no time to test, i.e. `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 0`, 
the pig has only one state - `alive`.

If `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 1` then the pig has a time to die from the poison,
that means that now there are two states available for the pig : `alive` or `dead`.  

One more step. If `minutesToTest / minutesToDie = 2` then there are three available 
states for the pig : `alive` / `dead after the first test` / `dead after the second test`.

> The number of available states for the pig is `states = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1`.
        
**How many buckets could test `x` pigs with 2 available states**

One pig could test 2 buckets - let's make him drink from the bucket 
number `1` and then wait `minutesToDie` time. If he is alive - the 
poison is in the bucket number `2`. If he is dead - the poison 
is in the bucket number `1`.

The same way two pigs could test $$2^2 = 4$$ buckets

> Hence if one pig has two available states, `x` pigs could
test $$2^x$$ buckets.

**How many buckets could test `x` pigs with `s` available states**

> After the discussion above, the answer is quite obvious : $$s^x$$ buckets.

Let's consider as an example one pig with 3 states, _i.e._ 
`s = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`, and show that
he could test `3` buckets.

**Solution**

Hence the problem is to find `x` such that $$\textrm{states}^x \ge \textrm{buckets}$$,
where `x` is a number of pigs, `states = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1`
is a number of states available for each pig, and 
$$\textrm{buckets}$$ is number of buckets.

[The solution is well known](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function) :
$$x \ge \log_{\textrm{states}}{\textrm{buckets}}$$. 
To simplify the code let's rewrite the equation with the help of 
[natural logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logarithmic_identities#Changing_the_base) :

$$
x \ge \frac{\log \textrm{buckets}}{\log \textrm{states}}
$$

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since it's a [constant time
solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7317571/7775414). 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.
