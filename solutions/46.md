#### Approach 1: Backtracking

[Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) 
is an algorithm for finding all
solutions by exploring all potential candidates.
If the solution candidate turns to be _not_ a solution 
(or at least not the _last_ one), 
backtracking algorithm discards it by making some changes 
on the previous step, *i.e.* _backtracks_ and then try again.

Here is a backtrack function 
which takes the index of the first integer to consider 
as an argument `backtrack(first)`.

* If the first integer to consider has index `n` that means 
that the current permutation is done.
* Iterate over the integers from index `first` to index `n - 1`.
    * Place `i`-th integer first in the permutation, 
    i.e. `swap(nums[first], nums[i])`.
    * Proceed to create all permutations which starts from 
    `i`-th integer : `backtrack(first + 1)`.
    * Now backtrack, i.e. `swap(nums[first], nums[i])` back.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\sum_{k = 1}^{N}{P(N, k)})$$ where $$P(N, k) = \frac{N!}{(N - k)!} = N (N - 1) ... (N - k + 1)$$
is so-called [_k-permutations_of_n_, or _partial permutation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#k-permutations_of_n). 

Here $$first + 1 = k$$ for the expression simplicity. 
The formula is easy to understand : for each $$k$$ (each $$first$$) 
one performs $$N(N - 1) ... (N - k + 1)$$ operations, 
and $$k$$ is going through the range of values from $$1$$ to $$N$$ (and $$first$$ from $$0$$ to $$N - 1$$). 

Let's do a rough estimation of the result : 
$$N! \le \sum_{k = 1}^{N}{\frac{N!}{(N - k)!}} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}{P(N, k)} \le N \times N!$$,
i.e. the algorithm performs better than $$\mathcal{O}(N \times N!)$$ and 
a bit slower than $$\mathcal{O}(N!)$$.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N!)$$ since one has to keep
`N!` solutions.
