#### Approach 1 : Transpose and then reverse

The obvious idea would be to transpose the matrix first and then
reverse each row. This simple approach already demonstrates the best
possible time complexity $$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$$.



* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$$. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since we do a rotation *in place*.

#### Approach 2 : Rotate four rectangles

**Intuition**

Approach 1 makes two passes through the matrix, 
though it's possible to make a rotation in one pass.

To figure out how let's check 
how each element in the angle moves during the rotation.

That gives us an idea to split a given matrix in four rectangles and
reduce the initial problem to the rotation of these rectangles.

Now the solution is quite straightforward - 
one could move across the elements 
in the first rectangle and rotate them using a temp list of `4` elements.

**Implementation**

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$$ is a complexity given by two inserted loops. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since we do a rotation *in place* 
and allocate only the list of `4` elements as a temporary helper.

#### Approach 3 : Rotate four rectangles in one single loop

The idea is the same as in the approach 2,
but everything is done in one single loop 
and hence it's a way more elegant
(kudos go to @[gxldragon](https://leetcode.com/gxldragon/)).



* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$$ is a complexity given by two inserted loops. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since we do a rotation *in place*.
