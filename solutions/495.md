#### Approach 1: One pass

**Intuition**

The problem is an example of merge interval questions which are now [quite popular
in Google](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/280433/Google-or-Phone-screen-or-Program-scheduling).

Typically such problems could be solved in a linear time in the case
of sorted input, like [here](https://leetcode.com/articles/insert-interval/), 
and in $$\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$$ time otherwise,
[here is an example](https://leetcode.com/articles/merge-intervals/).

Here one deals with a sorted input, and the problem could be solved in one pass
with a constant space. 
The idea is straightforward: consider only the interval between two attacks. 
Ashe spends in a poisoned condition the whole time interval
if this interval is shorter than the poisoning time duration `duration`, 
and `duration` otherwise. 

**Algorithm**

- Initiate total time in poisoned condition `total = 0`.

- Iterate over `timeSeries` list. At each step add to the total time
the minimum between interval length and the poisoning time duration `duration`. 

- Return `total + duration` to take the last attack into account.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$, where N is the length of the input list,
since we iterate the entire list.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$, it's a constant space solution.
