509. Inorder Successor in BST II | Algorithms | Medium | Tree

[TOC]

## Solution

--- 

#### Successor and Predecessor

> Successor = "after node", i.e. the next node in the inorder traversal, 
or the smallest node _after_ the current one.  

> Predecessor = "before node", i.e. the previous node in the inorder traversal, 
or the largest node _before_ the current one.

#### Approach 1: Iteration

**Intuition**

There are two possible situations here :

- Node has a right child, and hence its successor is somewhere
 lower in the tree. To find the successor, go to the right once
and then as many times to the left as you could.

- Node has no right child, then its successor is somewhere
 upper in the tree. To find the successor, go up till the node
 that is _left_ child of its parent. The answer is the parent.
 Beware that there could be no successor (= null successor) in such a situation.

**Algorithm**

1. If the node has a right child, and hence its successor is somewhere lower
in the tree. Go to the right once 
and then as many times to the left as you could.
Return the node you end up with.

2. Node has no right child, and hence its successor is somewhere
upper in the tree. Go up till the node
that is _left_ child of its parent. The answer is the parent.

**Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(H)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the tree. 
That means $$\mathcal{O}(\log N)$$ in the average case, 
and $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ in the worst case, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$, since no additional space is allocated during the calculation.
