#### Approach #1: Direct [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We will reverse each block of `2k` characters directly.

Each block starts at a multiple of `2k`: for example, `0, 2k, 4k, 6k, ...`.  One thing to be careful about is we may not reverse each block if there aren't enough characters.

To reverse a block of characters from `i` to `j`, we can swap characters in positions `i++` and `j--`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the size of `s`.  We build a helper array, plus reverse about half the characters in `s`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of `a`.
