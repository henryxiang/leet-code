61. Rotate List | Algorithms | Medium | Linked List, Two Pointers

## Solution

--- 

#### Approach 1: 

**Intuition**

The nodes in the list are already linked, 
and hence the rotation basically means 

- To close the linked list into the ring.

- To break the ring after the new tail and just in front of 
the new head.

> Where is the new head?

In the position `n - k`, where `n` is a number of nodes
in the list. The new tail is just before, in the position
`n - k - 1`. 

> We were assuming that `k < n`. 
What about the case of `k >= n`?

`k` could be rewritten as a sum `k = (k // n) * n + k % n`,
where the first term doesn't result in any rotation. 
Hence one could simply replace `k` by `k % n` to always
have number of rotation places smaller than `n`.

**Algorithm**

The algorithm is quite straightforward :

* Find the old tail and connect it with the head 
`old_tail.next = head` to close the ring. Compute
the length of the list `n` at the same time.

* Find the new tail, which is `(n - k % n - 1)`th node from the `head`
and the new head, which is `(n - k % n)`th node.

* Break the ring `new_tail.next = None` and return `new_head`.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ where $$N$$ is a number
of elements in the list.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since it's a
constant space solution.
