616. Add Bold Tag in String | Algorithms | Medium | String

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let's try to learn which letters end up bold, since the resulting answer will just be the canonical one - we put bold tags around each group of bold letters.

To do this, we'll check for all occurrences of each word and mark the corresponding letters bold.

**Algorithm**

Let's work on first setting `mask[i] = true` if and only if the `i`-th letter is bold.  For each starting position `i` in `S`, for each `word`, if `S[i]` starts with `word`, we'll set the appropriate letters bold.

Now armed with the correct `mask`, let's try to output the answer.  A letter in position `i` is the first bold letter of the group if `mask[i] && (i == 0 || !mask[i-1])`, and is the last bold letter if `mask[i] && (i == N-1 || !mask[i+1])`.  Alternatively, we could use `itertools.groupby` in Python.

Once we know which letters are the first and last bold letters of a group, we know where to put the `""` and `""` tags.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N\sum w_i)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S` and $$w_i$$ is the sum of `W`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$.
