#### Approach #1: Prefix Hash [Accepted]

**Intuition**

For each word in the sentence, we'll look at successive prefixes and see if we saw them before.

**Algorithm**

Store all the `roots` in a *Set* structure.  Then for each word, look at successive prefixes of that word.  If you find a prefix that is a root, replace the word with that prefix.  Otherwise, the prefix will just be the word itself, and we should add that to the final sentence answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(\sum w_i^2)$$ where $$w_i$$ is the length of the $$i$$-th word.  We might check every prefix, the $$i$$-th of which is $$O(w_i^2)$$ work.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of our sentence; the space used by `rootset`.

#### Approach #2: Trie [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Put all the roots in a trie (prefix tree).  Then for any query word, we can find the smallest root that was a prefix in linear time.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of the `sentence`.  Every query of a word is in linear time.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of our trie.
