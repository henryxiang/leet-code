649. Dota2 Senate | Algorithms | Medium | Greedy

#### Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]

**Intuition**

A senator performing a ban doesn't need to use it on another senator immediately.  We can wait to see when another team's senator will vote, then use that ban retroactively.

**Algorithm**

Put the senators in an integer queue: `1` for `'Radiant'` and `0` for `'Dire'`.

Now process the queue: if there is a floating ban for that senator, exercise it and continue.  Otherwise, add a floating ban against the other team, and enqueue this senator again.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the size of the senate.  Every vote removes one senator from the other team.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the space used by our queue.
