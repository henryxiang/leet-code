#### Approach #1: Prime Factorization [Accepted]

**Intuition**

We can break our moves into groups of `(copy, paste, ..., paste)`.  Let `C` denote copying and `P` denote pasting.  Then for example, in the sequence of moves `CPPCPPPPCP`, the groups would be `[CPP][CPPPP][CP]`.

Say these groups have lengths `g_1, g_2, ...`.  After parsing the first group, there are `g_1` `'A'`s.  After parsing the second group, there are `g_1 * g_2` `'A'`s, and so on.  At the end, there are `g_1 * g_2 * ... * g_n` `'A'`s.

We want exactly `N = g_1 * g_2 * ... * g_n`.  If any of the `g_i` are composite, say `g_i = p * q`, then we can split this group into two groups (the first of which has one copy followed by `p-1` pastes, while the second group having one copy and `q-1` pastes).

Such a split never uses more moves: we use `p+q` moves when splitting, and `pq` moves previously.  As `p+q = 2` and `q >= 2`.

**Algorithm**
By the above argument, we can suppose `g_1, g_2, ...` is the prime factorization of `N`, and the answer is therefore the sum of these prime factors.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(\sqrt{N})$$.  When `N` is the square of a prime, our loop does $$O(\sqrt{N})$$ steps.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$, the space used by `ans` and `d`.
