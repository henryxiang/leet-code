#### Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]

**Intuition**

We can simulate the position of the robot after each command.

**Algorithm**

Initially, the robot is at `(x, y) = (0, 0)`.  If the move is `'U'`, the robot goes to `(x, y-1)`; if the move is `'R'`, the robot goes to `(x, y) = (x+1, y)`, and so on.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `moves`.  We iterate through the string.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.  In Java, our character array is $$O(N)$$.
