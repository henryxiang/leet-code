#### Approach #1: Iterate Through Grid

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each cell in the grid, look at the immediate neighbors - up to 9 of them, including the original cell.

Then, we will add the sum of the neighbors into `ans[r][c]` while recording `count`, the number of such neighbors.  The final answer is the sum divided by the count.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of pixels in our image.  We iterate over every pixel.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of our answer.
