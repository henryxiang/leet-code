669. Trim a Binary Search Tree | Algorithms | Easy | Tree

## Solution

#### Approach #1: Recursion [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let `trim(node)` be the desired answer for the subtree at that node.  We can construct the answer recursively.

**Algorithm**

When $$\text{node.val > R}$$, we know that the trimmed binary tree must occur to the left of the node. Similarly, when $$\text{node.val < L}$$, the trimmed binary tree occurs to the right of the node. Otherwise, we will trim both sides of the tree.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the total number of nodes in the given tree.  We visit each node at most once.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$.  Even though we don't explicitly use any additional memory, the call stack of our recursion could be as large as the number of nodes in the worst case.
