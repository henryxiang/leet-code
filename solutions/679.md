**Intuition and Algorithm**

There are only 4 cards and only 4 operations that can be performed.  Even when all operations do not commute, that gives us an upper bound of $$12 * 6 * 2 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 9216$$ possibilities, which makes it feasible to just try them all.  Specifically, we choose two numbers (with order) in 12 ways and perform one of 4 operations (12 * 4). Then, with 3 remaining numbers, we choose 2 of them and perform one of 4 operations (6 * 4).  Finally we have two numbers left and make a final choice of 2 * 4 possibilities.

We will perform 3 binary operations (`+, -, *, /` are the operations) on either our numbers or resulting numbers.  Because `-` and `/` do not commute, we must be careful to consider both `a / b` and `b / a`.

For every way to remove two numbers `a, b` in our list, and for each possible result they can make, like `a+b`, `a/b`, etc., we will recursively solve the problem on this smaller list of numbers.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(1)$$.  There is a hard limit of 9216 possibilities, and we do $$O(1)$$ work for each of them.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.  Our intermediate arrays are at most 4 elements, and the number made is bounded by an $$O(1)$$ factor.
