#### Approach #1: Stack [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's maintain the value of each valid round on a stack as we process the data.  A stack is ideal since we only deal with operations involving the last or second-last valid round.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `ops`.  We parse through every element in the given array once, and do $$O(1)$$ work for each element.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the space used to store our `stack`.
