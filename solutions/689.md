#### Approach #1: Ad-Hoc [Accepted]

**Intuition**

It is natural to consider an array `W` of each interval's sum, where each interval is the given length `K`.  To create `W`, we can either use prefix sums, or manage the sum of the interval as a window slides along the array.

From there, we approach the reduced problem: Given some array `W` and an integer `K`, what is the lexicographically smallest tuple of indices `(i, j, k)` with `i + K <= j` and `j + K <= k` that maximizes `W[i] + W[j] + W[k]`?

**Algorithm**

Suppose we fixed `j`.  We would like to know on the intervals $$i \in [0, j-K]$$ and $$k \in [j+K, \text{len}(W)-1]$$, where the largest value of $$W[i]$$ (and respectively $$W[k]$$) occurs first.  (Here, first means the smaller index.)

We can solve these problems with dynamic programming.  For example, if we know that $$i$$ is where the largest value of $$W[i]$$ occurs first on $$[0, 5]$$, then on $$[0, 6]$$ the first occurrence of the largest $$W[i]$$ must be either $$i$$ or $$6$$.  If say, $$6$$ is better, then we set `best = 6`.

At the end, `left[z]` will be the first occurrence of the largest value of `W[i]` on the interval $$i \in [0, z]$$, and `right[z]` will be the same but on the interval $$i \in [z, \text{len}(W) - 1]$$.  This means that for some choice `j`, the candidate answer must be `(left[j-K], j, right[j+K])`.  We take the candidate that produces the maximum `W[i] + W[j] + W[k]`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of the array.  Every loop is bounded in the number of steps by $$N$$, and does $$O(1)$$ work.

* Space complexity:  $$O(N)$$.  `W`, `left`, and `right` all take $$O(N)$$ memory.
