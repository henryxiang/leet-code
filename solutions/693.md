#### Approach #1: Convert to String [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's convert the given number into a string of binary digits.  Then, we should simply check that no two adjacent digits are the same.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(1)$$.  For arbitrary inputs, we do $$O(w)$$ work, where $$w$$ is the number of bits in `n`.  However, $$w \leq 32$$.

* Space complexity: $$O(1)$$, or alternatively $$O(w)$$.

#### Approach #2: Divide By Two [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can get the last bit and the rest of the bits via `n % 2` and `n // 2` operations.  Let's remember `cur`, the last bit of `n`.  If the last bit ever equals the last bit of the remaining, then two adjacent bits have the same value, and the answer is `False`.  Otherwise, the answer is `True`.

Also note that instead of `n % 2` and `n // 2`, we could have used operators `n & 1` and `n >>= 1` instead.
