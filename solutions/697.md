#### Approach #1: Left and Right Index [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

An array that has degree `d`, must have some element `x` occur `d` times.  If some subarray has the same degree, then some element `x` (that occured `d` times), still occurs `d` times.  The shortest such subarray would be from the first occurrence of `x` until the last occurrence.

For each element in the given array, let's know `left`, the index of its first occurrence; and `right`, the index of its last occurrence.  For example, with `nums = [1,2,3,2,5]` we have `left[2] = 1` and `right[2] = 3`.

Then, for each element `x` that occurs the maximum number of times, `right[x] - left[x] + 1` will be our candidate answer, and we'll take the minimum of those candidates.

**Python**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def findShortestSubArray(self, nums):
        left, right, count = {}, {}, {}
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x not in left: left[x] = i
            right[x] = i
            count[x] = count.get(x, 0) + 1

        ans = len(nums)
        degree = max(count.values())
        for x in count:
            if count[x] == degree:
                ans = min(ans, right[x] - left[x] + 1)

        return ans
```

**Java**
```java
class Solution {
    public int findShortestSubArray(int[] nums) {
        Map left = new HashMap(),
            right = new HashMap(), count = new HashMap();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int x = nums[i];
            if (left.get(x) == null) left.put(x, i);
            right.put(x, i);
            count.put(x, count.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
        }

        int ans = nums.length;
        int degree = Collections.max(count.values());
        for (int x: count.keySet()) {
            if (count.get(x) == degree) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, right.get(x) - left.get(x) + 1);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `nums`.  Every loop is through $$O(N)$$ items with $$O(1)$$ work inside the for-block.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the space used by `left`, `right`, and `count`.
