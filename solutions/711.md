#### Approach #1: Canonical Hash [Accepted]

**Intuition**

As in *Approach #1* to the sister problem [Number of Distinct Islands](https://leetcode.com/articles/number-of-distinct-islands/), we determine local coordinates for each island.

Afterwards, we will rotate and reflect the coordinates about the origin and translate the shape so that the bottom-left-most coordinate is (0, 0).  At the end, the smallest of these lists coordinates will be the *canonical representation* of the shape.

**Algorithm**

We feature two different implementations, but the core idea is the same.  We start with the code from the previous problem, *Number of Distinct Islands*.

For each of 8 possible rotations and reflections of the shape, we will perform the transformation and then translate the shape so that the bottom-left-most coordinate is (0, 0).  Afterwards, we will consider the canonical hash of the shape to be the maximum of these 8 intermediate hashes.

In Python, the motivation to use complex numbers is that rotation by 90 degrees is the same as multiplying by the imaginary unit, `1j`.  In Java, we manipulate the coordinates directly.  The 8 rotations and reflections of each point are `(x, y), (-x, y), (x, -y), (-x, -y), (y, x), (-y, x), (y, -x), (-y, -x)`.

**Python**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def numDistinctIslands2(self, grid):
        seen = set()
        def explore(r, c):
            if (0 <= r < len(grid) and 0 <= c < len(grid[0]) and
                    grid[r][c] and (r, c) not in seen):
                seen.add((r, c))
                shape.add(complex(r, c))
                explore(r+1, c)
                explore(r-1, c)
                explore(r, c+1)
                explore(r, c-1)

        def canonical(shape):
            def translate(shape):
                w = complex(min(z.real for z in shape),
                            min(z.imag for z in shape))
                return sorted(str(z-w) for z in shape)

            ans = None
            for k in xrange(4):
                ans = max(ans, translate([z * (1j)**k for z in shape]))
                ans = max(ans,  translate([complex(z.imag, z.real) * (1j)**k
                                           for z in shape]))
            return tuple(ans)

        shapes = set()
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                shape = set()
                explore(r, c)
                if shape:
                    shapes.add(canonical(shape))

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(R*C \log{(R*C)})$$, where $$R$$ is the number of rows in the given `grid`, and $$C$$ is the number of columns.  We visit every square once, and each square belongs to at most one shape.  The log factor comes from sorting the shapes.

* Space complexity: $$O(R*C)$$, the space used to keep track of the shapes.
