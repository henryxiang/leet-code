712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings | Algorithms | Medium | Dynamic Programming

[TOC]


#### Approach #1: Dynamic Programming [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let `dp[i][j]` be the answer to the problem for the strings `s1[i:], s2[j:]`.

When one of the input strings is empty, the answer is the ASCII-sum of the other string.  We can calculate this cumulatively using code like `dp[i][s2.length()] = dp[i+1][s2.length()] + s1.codePointAt(i)`.

When `s1[i] == s2[j]`, we have `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1]` as we can ignore these two characters.

When `s1[i] != s2[j]`, we will have to delete at least one of them.  We'll have `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of the answers after both deletion options.

The solutions presented will use *bottom-up* dynamic programming.

**Python**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def minimumDeleteSum(self, s1, s2):
        dp = [[0] * (len(s2) + 1) for _ in xrange(len(s1) + 1)]

        for i in xrange(len(s1) - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[i][len(s2)] = dp[i+1][len(s2)] + ord(s1[i])
        for j in xrange(len(s2) - 1, -1, -1):
            dp[len(s1)][j] = dp[len(s1)][j+1] + ord(s2[j])

        for i in xrange(len(s1) - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in xrange(len(s2) - 1, -1, -1):
                if s1[i] == s2[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j] + ord(s1[i]),
                                   dp[i][j+1] + ord(s2[j]))

        return dp[0][0]
```

**Java**
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeleteSum(String s1, String s2) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s1.length() + 1][s2.length() + 1];

        for (int i = s1.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            dp[i][s2.length()] = dp[i+1][s2.length()] + s1.codePointAt(i);
        }
        for (int j = s2.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            dp[s1.length()][j] = dp[s1.length()][j+1] + s2.codePointAt(j);
        }
        for (int i = s1.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = s2.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j+1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i+1][j] + s1.codePointAt(i),
                                        dp[i][j+1] + s2.codePointAt(j));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0];
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(M*N)$$, where $$M, N$$ are the lengths of the given strings.  We use nested for loops: each loop is $$O(M)$$ and $$O(N)$$ respectively.

* Space Complexity: $$O(M*N)$$, the space used by `dp`.
