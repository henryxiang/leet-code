714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee | Algorithms | Medium | Array, Dynamic Programming, Greedy

[TOC]


#### Approach #1: Dynamic Programming [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

At the end of the `i`-th day, we maintain `cash`, the maximum profit we could have if we did not have a share of stock, and `hold`, the maximum profit we could have if we owned a share of stock.

To transition from the `i`-th day to the `i+1`-th day, we either sell our stock `cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)` or buy a stock `hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])`.  At the end, we want to return `cash`.  We can transform `cash` first without using temporary variables because selling and buying on the same day can't be better than just continuing to hold the stock.

**Python**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxProfit(self, prices, fee):
        cash, hold = 0, -prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)
            hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])
        return cash
```

**Java**
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int cash = 0, hold = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            cash = Math.max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee);
            hold = Math.max(hold, cash - prices[i]);
        }
        return cash;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of prices.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$, the space used by `cash` and `hold`.
