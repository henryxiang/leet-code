#### Approach #1: Boundary Count [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

When booking a new event `[start, end)`, count `delta[start]++` and `delta[end]--`.  When processing the values of `delta` in sorted order of their keys, the largest such value is the answer.

In Python, we sort the set each time instead, as there is no analog to *TreeMap* available.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of events booked.  For each new event, we traverse `delta` in $$O(N)$$ time.  In Python, this is $$O(N^2 \log N)$$ owing to the extra sort step.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of `delta`.
