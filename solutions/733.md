733. Flood Fill | Algorithms | Easy | Depth-first Search

#### Approach #1: Depth-First Search [Accepted]

**Intuition**

We perform the algorithm explained in the problem description: paint the starting pixels, plus adjacent pixels of the same color, and so on.

**Algorithm**

Say `color` is the color of the starting pixel.  Let's floodfill the starting pixel: we change the color of that pixel to the new color, then check the 4 neighboring pixels to make sure they are valid pixels of the same `color`, and of the valid ones, we floodfill those, and so on.

We can use a function `dfs` to perform a floodfill on a target pixel.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of pixels in the image.  We might process every pixel.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of the implicit call stack when calling `dfs`.
