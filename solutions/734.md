#### Approach #1: Set [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

To check whether `words1[i]` and `words2[i]` are similar, either they are the same word, or `(words1[i], words2[i])` or `(words2[i], words1[i])` appear in `pairs`.

To check whether `(words1[i], words2[i])` appears in `pairs` quickly, we could put all such pairs into a Set structure.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N+P)$$, where $$N$$ is the maximum length of `words1` and `words2`, and $$P$$ is the length of `pairs`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(P)$$, the size of `pairs`.  Intermediate objects created in evaluating whether a pair of words are similar are created one at a time, so they don't take additional space.
