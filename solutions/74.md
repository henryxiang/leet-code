#### Approach 1: Binary search

**Intuition**

One could notice that the input matrix `m x n` could be considered 
as a sorted array of length `m x n`.

Sorted array is a perfect candidate for the binary search
because the element index in this _virtual_ array (_for sure we're 
not going to construct it for real_) could be easily
transformed into the row and column in the initial matrix

> `row = idx // n` and `col = idx % n`.

**Algorithm**

The algorithm is a standard binary search : 

* Initialise left and right indexes 
`left = 0` and `right = m x n - 1`.

* While `left < right` :

    * Pick up the index in the middle of the virtual array 
    as a pivot index : `pivot_idx = (left + right) / 2`.
    
    * The index corresponds to `row = pivot_idx // n` and
    `col = pivot_idx % n` in the initial matrix, and hence
    one could get the `pivot_element`.
    This element splits the virtual array in two parts. 
    
    * Compare `pivot_element` and `target` 
    to identify in which part one has to look for `target`.
        
**Implementation**

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(\log(m n))$$ since it's a standard binary search. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.
