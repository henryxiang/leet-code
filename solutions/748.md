748. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others | Algorithms | Easy | Array

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Linear Scan [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Scan through the array to find the unique largest element `m`, keeping track of it's index `maxIndex`.

Scan through the array again.  If we find some `x != m` with `m < 2*x`, we should return `-1`.

Otherwise, we should return `maxIndex`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of `nums`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$, the space used by our `int` variables.
