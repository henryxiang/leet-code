749. Shortest Completing Word | Algorithms | Easy | Hash Table

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Compare Counts [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

A natural question is, how to tell whether a `word` like `"steps"` completes a `licensePlate` like `"12s pst"`?

We count the number of letters in both `word` and `licensePlate`, converting to lowercase and ignoring non-letter characters.  If the count of each letter is greater or equal in the word, then that word completes the `licensePlate`.

From the words that complete `licensePlate`, we should keep the one with the shortest length (with ties broken by whether it occurs first.)



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ where $$N$$ is the length of `words`, and assuming the lengths of `licensePlate` and `words[i]` are bounded by $$O(1)$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$ in additional space.
