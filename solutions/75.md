## Solution

#### Approach 1: One Pass 

**Intuition**

The problem is known as [Dutch National Flag Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_national_flag_problem)
and first was proposed by [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra).
The idea is to attribute a color to each number and then to
arrange them following the order of colors on the Dutch flag.

Let's use here three pointers to track the 
rightmost boundary of zeros, the leftmost boundary of twos
and the current element under the consideration.

The idea of solution is to move `curr` pointer along the
array, if `nums[curr] = 0` - swap it with `nums[p0]`,
if `nums[curr] = 2` - swap it with `nums[p2]`.

**Algorithm**

- Initialise the rightmost boundary of zeros : `p0 = 0`.
During the algorithm execution `nums[idx < p0] = 0`.

- Initialise the leftmost boundary of twos : `p2 = n - 1`.
During the algorithm execution `nums[idx > p2] = 2`.

- Initialise the index of current element to consider : `curr = 0`.

- While `curr <= p2` :

    - If `nums[curr] = 0` : swap `curr`th and `p0`th elements and 
    move both pointers to the right.
    
    - If `nums[curr] = 2` : swap `curr`th and `p2`th elements. Move
    pointer `p2` to the left. 
    
    - If `nums[curr] = 1` : move pointer `curr` to the right.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N)$$ since it's one pass
along the array of length $$N$$.
 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$ since it's a constant space
solution.
