#### Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let's work on simulating one turn of the process.  We can repeat this as necessary while there are still infected regions.

**Algorithm**

Though the implementation is long, the algorithm is straightforward.  We perform the following steps:

* Find all viral regions (connected components), additionally for each region keeping track of the frontier (neighboring uncontaminated cells), and the perimeter of the region.

* Disinfect the most viral region, adding it's perimeter to the answer.

* Spread the virus in the remaining regions outward by 1 square.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O((R*C)^{\frac{4}{3}})$$ where $$R, C$$ is the number of rows and columns.  After time $$t$$, viral regions that are alive must have size at least $$t^2 + (t-1)^2$$, so the total number removed across all time is $$\Omega(t^3) \leq R*C$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(R*C)$$ in additional space.
