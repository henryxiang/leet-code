**Intuition**

The crux of the problem is to put `+` and `-` signs on the numbers `1, 2, 3, ..., k` so that the sum is `target`.

When `target  0`.

Now let's say `k` is the smallest number with `S = 1 + 2 + ... + k >= target`.  If `S == target`, the answer is clearly `k`.

If `S > target`, we need to change some number signs.  If `delta = S - target` is even, then we can always find a subset of `{1, 2, ..., k}` equal to `delta / 2` and switch the signs, so the answer is `k`.  (This depends on `T = delta / 2` being at most `S`.)  [The proof is simple: either `T <= k` and we choose it, or we choose `k` in our subset and try to solve the same instance of the problem for `T -= k` and the set `{1, 2, ..., k-1}`.]

Otherwise, if `delta` is odd, we can't do it, as every sign change from positive to negative changes the sum by an even number.  So let's consider a candidate answer of `k+1`, which changes `delta` by `k+1`.  If this is odd, then `delta` will be even and we can have an answer of `k+1`.  Otherwise, `delta` will be odd, and we will have an answer of `k+2`.

For concrete examples of the above four cases, consider the following:

* If `target = 3`, then `k = 2, delta = 0` and the answer is `k = 2`.
* If `target = 4`, then `k = 3, delta = 2`, delta is even and the answer is `k = 3`.
* If `target = 7`, then `k = 4, delta = 3`, delta is odd and adding `k+1` makes delta even.  The answer is `k+1 = 5`.
* If `target = 5`, then `k = 3, delta = 1`, delta is odd and adding `k+1` keeps delta odd.  The answer is `k+2 = 5`.

**Algorithm**

Subtract `++k` from `target` until it goes non-positive.  Then `k` will be as described, and `target` will be `delta` as described.  We can output the four cases above: if `delta` is even then the answer is `k`, if `delta` is odd then the answer is `k+1` or `k+2` depending on the parity of `k`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(\sqrt{\text{target}})$$.  Our while loop needs this many steps, as $$1 + 2 + \dots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.
