#### Approach #1: Hash Table [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Take the example `A = [12, 28, 46]`, `B = [46, 12, 28]`.  We want to know where the `12` occurs in `B`, say at position `1`; then where the `28` occurs in `B`, which is position `2`; then where the `46` occurs in `B`, which is position `0`.

If we had a dictionary (hash table) `D = {46: 0, 12: 1, 28: 2}`, then this question could be handled easily.

**Algorithm**

Create the hash table `D` as described above.  Then, the answer is a list of `D[A[i]]` for `i = 0, 1, ...`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of $$A$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$.
