767. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation | Algorithms | Easy | Bit Manipulation

#### Approach #1: Direct [Accepted]
**Intuition and Approach**

For each number from `L` to `R`, let's find out how many set bits it has.  If that number is `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17`, or `19`, then we add one to our count.  We only need primes up to 19 because $$R \leq 10^6 < 2^{20}$$.



**Complexity Analysis**
    
* Time Complexity: $$O(D)$$, where $$D = R-L$$ is the number of integers considered.  In a bit complexity model, this would be $$O(D\log D)$$ as we have to count the bits in $$O(\log D)$$ time.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.
