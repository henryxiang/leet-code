#### Approach #1: Greedy [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let's try to repeatedly choose the smallest left-justified partition.
Consider the first label, say it's `'a'`.  The first partition must include it, and also the last occurrence of `'a'`.
However, between those two occurrences of `'a'`, there could be other labels that make the minimum size of this partition bigger.  For example, in `"abccaddbeffe"`, the minimum first partition is `"abccaddb"`. 
This gives us the idea for the algorithm:  For each letter encountered, process the last occurrence of that letter, extending the current partition `[anchor, j]` appropriately.

**Algorithm**

We need an array `last[char] -> index of S where char occurs last`.
Then, let `anchor` and `j` be the start and end of the current partition.
If we are at a label that occurs last at some index after `j`, we'll extend the partition `j = last[c]`.  If we are at the end of the partition (`i == j`) then we'll append a partition size to our answer, and set the start of our new partition to `i+1`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of $$S$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$.
