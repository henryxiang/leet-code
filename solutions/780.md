#### Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's try to find the smallest left-most chunk.  If the first `k` elements are `[0, 1, ..., k-1]`, then it can be broken into a chunk, and we have a smaller instance of the same problem.

We can check whether `k+1` elements chosen from `[0, 1, ..., n-1]` are `[0, 1, ..., k]` by checking whether the maximum of that choice is `k`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `arr`

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.
