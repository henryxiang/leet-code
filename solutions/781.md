#### Approach #1: Polynomial Class [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Keep a class `Poly` that knows a map from a list of free variables to a coefficient, and support operations on this class.

**Algorithm**

Each function is straightforward individually.  Let's list the functions we use:

* `Poly:add(this, that)` returns the result of `this + that`.
* `Poly:sub(this, that)` returns the result of `this - that`.
* `Poly:mul(this, that)` returns the result of `this * that`.
* `Poly:evaluate(this, evalmap)` returns the polynomial after replacing all free variables with constants as specified by `evalmap`.
* `Poly:toList(this)` returns the polynomial in the correct output format.

* `Solution::combine(left, right, symbol)` returns the result of applying the binary operator represented by `symbol` to `left` and `right`.
* `Solution::make(expr)` makes a new `Poly` represented by either the constant or free variable specified by `expr`.
* `Solution::parse(expr)` parses an expression into a new `Poly`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  Let $$N$$ is the length of `expression` and $$M$$ is the length of `evalvars` and `evalints`.  With an expression like `(a + b) * (c + d) * (e + f) * ...` the complexity is $$O(2^N + M)$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N + M)$$.
