782. Jewels and Stones | Algorithms | Easy | Hash Table

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each stone, check whether it matches any of the jewels.  We can check with a linear scan.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(J\text{.length} * S\text{.length}))$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$ additional space complexity in Python.  In Java, this can be $$O(J\text{.length} * S\text{.length}))$$ because of the creation of new arrays.

#### Approach #2: Hash Set [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each stone, check whether it matches any of the jewels.  We can check efficiently with a *Hash Set*.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(J\text{.length} + S\text{.length}))$$.  The $$O(J\text{.length})$$ part comes from creating `J`.  The $$O(S\text{.length})$$ part comes from searching `S`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(J\text{.length})$$.
