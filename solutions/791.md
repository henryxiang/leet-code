#### Approach #1: Recursion [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

The `root` node either belongs to the first half or the second half.  Let's say it belongs to the first half.

Then, because the given tree is a *binary search tree* (BST), the entire subtree at `root.left` must be in the first half.  However, the subtree at `root.right` may have nodes in either halves, so it needs to be split.



    



In the diagram above, the thick lines represent the main child relationships between the nodes, while the thinner colored lines represent the subtrees after the split.

Lets say our secondary answer `bns = split(root.right)` is the result of such a split.  Recall that `bns[0]` and `bns[1]` will both be BSTs on either side of the split.  The left half of `bns` must be in the first half, and it must be to the right of `root` for the first half to remain a BST.  The right half of `bns` is the right half in the final answer.



    



The diagram above explains how we merge the two halves of `split(root.right)` with the main tree, and illustrates the line of code `root.right = bns[0]` in the implementations.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the input tree, as each node is checked once.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
