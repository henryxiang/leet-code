#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We'll make each row exactly as directed in the problem statement.  We only need to remember the last row.

Unfortunately, the strings could have length around 1 billion, as they double on each row, so this approach is not efficient enough.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$.  We parse rows with lengths $$2^0 + 2^1 + \cdots + 2^{N-1}$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$, the length of the `lastrow`.

#### Approach 2: Recursion (Parent Variant)

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Since each row is made only using information from the previous row, let's try to write the answer in terms of bits from the previous row.



    



In particular, if we write say `"0110"` which generates `"01101001"`, then the first `"0"` generates the first `"01"` in the next row; the next digit `"1"` generates the next `"10"`, the next `"1"` generates the next `"10"`, and the last `"0"` generates the last `"01"`.



    



In general, the `K`th digit's parent is going to be `(K+1) / 2`.  If the parent is `0`, then the digit will be the same as `1 - (K%2)`.  If the parent is `1`, the digit will be the opposite, ie. `K%2`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.  It takes $$N-1$$ steps to find the answer.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.

#### Approach 3: Recursion (Flip Variant)

**Intuition and Algorithm**

As in *Approach #2*, we could try to write the bit in terms of it's previous bit.

When writing a few rows of the sequence, we notice a pattern: the second half is always the first half "flipped": namely, that `'0'` becomes `'1'` and `'1'` becomes `'0'`.

We can prove this assertion by induction.  The key idea is if a string $$X$$ generates $$Y$$, then a flipped string $$X'$$ generates $$Y'$$.

This leads to the following algorithm idea: if `K` is in the second half, then we could put `K -= (1 << N-2)` so that it is in the first half, and flip the final answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.  It takes $$N-1$$ steps to find the answer.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.

#### Approach 4: Binary Count

**Intuition and Algorithm**

As in *Approach #3*, the second half of every row is the first half flipped.

When the indexes `K` are written in binary (now indexing from zero), indexes of the second half of a row are ones with the first bit set to 1.

This means when applying the algorithm in *Approach #3* virtually, the number of times we will flip the final answer is just the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `K-1`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\log N)$$, the number of binary bits in `N`.  If $$\log N$$ is taken to be bounded, this can be considered to be $$O(1)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.  (In Python, `bin(X)` creates a string of length $$O(\log X)$$, which could be avoided.)
