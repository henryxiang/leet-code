#### Approach #1: Write to Array [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Write all the values to an array, then sort it.  The minimum distance must occur between two adjacent values in the sorted list.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.  The complexity comes from the sorting operation.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, the size of `vals`.

#### Approach #2: In-Order Traversal [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

In a binary search tree, an in-order traversal outputs the values of the tree in order.  By remembering the previous value in this order, we could iterate over each possible difference, keeping the smallest one.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.  We iterate over every node once.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(H)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the tree.  This is the space used by the implicit call stack when calling `dfs`.
