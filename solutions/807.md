#### Approach #1: Count and Write [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let's first write to our answer the elements of `T` that occur in `S`, in order of `S`.  After, we'll write any elements of `T` we didn't write.  This obviously keeps all the ordering relationships we wanted.

In the second write, the order doesn't matter because those elements aren't in `S`, so there are no ordering relationships these elements have to satisfy.

**Algorithm**

The trick is to count the elements of `T`.  After we have some `count[char] = (the number of occurrences of char in T)`, we can write these elements in the order we want.  The order is `S + (characters not in S in any order)`.

For more details on the algorithm, please see the inlined comments in each implementation.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(S.\text{length} + T.\text{length})$$, the time it takes to iterate through `S` and `T`

* Space Complexity:  $$O(T.\text{length})$$.  We count at most 26 different lowercase letters, but the final answer has the same length as `T`.
