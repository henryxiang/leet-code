#### Approach #1: Recursion [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Since the graph is a directed, acyclic graph, any path from `A` to `B` is going to be composed of `A` plus a path from any neighbor of `A` to `B`.  We can use a recursion to return the answer.

**Algorithm**

Let `N` be the number of nodes in the graph.  If we are at node `N-1`, the answer is just the path `{N-1}`.  Otherwise, if we are at node `node`, the answer is `{node} + {path from nei to N-1}` for each neighbor `nei` of `node`.  This is a natural setting to use a recursion to form the answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^N N^2)$$.  We can have exponentially many paths, and for each such path, our prepending operation `path.add(0, node)` will be $$O(N^2)$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(2^N N)$$, the size of the output dominating the final space complexity.
