#### Approach #1: Simulation [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Instead of keeping track of how much champagne should end up in a glass, keep track of the total amount of champagne that flows through a glass.  For example, if `poured = 10` cups are poured at the top, then the total flow-through of the top glass is `10`; the total flow-through of each glass in the second row is `4.5`, and so on.

**Algorithm**

In general, if a glass has flow-through `X`, then `Q = (X - 1.0) / 2.0` quantity of champagne will equally flow left and right.  We can simulate the entire pour for 100 rows of glasses.  A glass at `(r, c)` will have excess champagne flow towards `(r+1, c)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(R^2)$$, where $$R$$ is the number of rows.  As this is fixed, we can consider this complexity to be $$O(1)$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(R^2)$$, or $$O(1)$$ by the reasoning above.
