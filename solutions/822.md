822. Unique Morse Code Words | Algorithms | Easy | String

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Hash Set [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can transform each `word` into it's Morse Code representation.

After, we put all transformations into a set `seen`, and return the size of the set.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(S)$$, where $$S$$ is the sum of the lengths of words in `words`.  We iterate through each character of each word in `words`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(S)$$.
