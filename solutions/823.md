**Intuition and Algorithm**

First, let's get a sense of the condition that `average(B) = average(C)`, where `B, C` are defined in the problem statement.

Say `A` (the input array) has `N` elements which sum to `S`, and `B` (one of the splitting sets) has `K` elements which sum to `X`.  Then the equation for `average(B) = average(C)` becomes $$\frac{X}{K} = \frac{S-X}{N-K}$$.  This reduces to $$X(N-K) = (S-X)K$$ which is $$\frac{X}{K} = \frac{S}{N}$$.  That is, `average(B) = average(A)`.

Now, we could delete `average(A)` from each element `A[i]` without changing our choice for `B`.  (`A[i] -= mu`, where `mu = average(A)`).  This means we just want to choose a set `B` that sums to `0`.

Trying all $$2^N$$ sets is still too many choices, so we will create sets of sums `left, right` of the approximately $$2^{N/2}$$ choices on the left and on the right separately.  (That is, `left` is a set of sums of every powerset in the first half of A, and `right` is the set of sums of every powerset in the second half of A).  Then, it is true if we find $$0$$ in these powersets, or if two sums in different halves cancel out (`-x in right for x in left`), except for one minor detail below.

Care must be taken that we do not specify sets that would make the original `B` or `C` empty.  If `sleft = A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[N/2 - 1]`, and `sright = A[N/2] + ... + A[N-1]`, (where `A[i]` was transformed to the new `A[i] - average(A)`) then we cannot choose both (`sleft, sright`).  This is correct because if for example `sleft` was a sum reached by a strictly smaller powerset than `{A[0], A[1], ..., A[N/2 - 1]}`, then the difference between these sets would be non-empty and have sum `0`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^{N/2})$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(2^{N/2})$$.
