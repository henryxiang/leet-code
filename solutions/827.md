#### Approach #1: Run Length Encoding [Accepted]

**Intuition**

For some word, write the head character of every group, and the count of that group.  For example, for `"abbcccddddaaaaa"`, we'll write the "key" of `"abcda"`, and the "count" `[1,2,3,4,5]`.

Let's see if a `word` is stretchy.  Evidently, it needs to have the same key as `S`.

Now, let's say we have individual counts `c1 = S.count[i]` and `c2 = word.count[i]`.

* If `c1 < c2`, then we can't make the `i`th group of `word` equal to the `i`th word of `S` by adding characters.

* If `c1 >= 3`, then we can add letters to the `i`th group of `word` to match the `i`th group of `S`, as the latter is *extended*.

* Else, if `c1 < 3`, then we must have `c2 == c1` for the `i`th groups of `word` and `S` to match.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(QK)$$, where $$Q$$ is the length of `words` (at least 1), and $$K$$ is the maximum length of a word.

* Space Complexity: $$O(K)$$.
