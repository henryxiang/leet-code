#### Approach #1: Hash Map [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

The algorithm is straightforward: we just do what the problem statement tells us to do.

For an address like `a.b.c`, we will count `a.b.c`, `b.c`, and `c`.  For an address like `x.y`, we will count `x.y` and `y`.

To count these strings, we will use a hash map.  To split the strings into the required pieces, we will use library `split` functions.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `cpdomains`, and assuming the length of `cpdomains[i]` is fixed.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the space used in our count.
