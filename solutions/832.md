#### Approach #1: Recursion [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Prune children of the tree recursively.  The only decisions at each node are whether to prune the left child or the right child.

**Algorithm**

We'll use a function `containsOne(node)` that does two things: it tells us whether the subtree at this `node` contains a `1`, and it also prunes all subtrees not containing `1`.

If for example, `node.left` does not contain a one, then we should prune it via `node.left = null`.

Also, the parent needs to be checked.  If for example the tree is a single node `0`, the answer is an empty tree.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.  We process each node once.

* Space Complexity: $$O(H)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the tree.  This represents the size of the implicit call stack in our recursion.
