#### Approach #1: Cartesian Product [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each place to put the comma, we separate the string into two fragments.  For example, with a string like `"1234"`, we could separate it into fragments `"1" and "234"`, `"12" and "34"`, or `"123"` and `"4"`.

Then, for each fragment, we have a choice of where to put the period, to create a list `make(...)` of choices.  For example, `"123"` could be made into `"1.23"`, `"12.3"`, or `"123"`.

Because of extranneous zeroes, we should ignore possibilities where the part of the fragment to the `left` of the decimal starts with `"0"` (unless it is exactly `"0"`), and ignore possibilities where the part of the fragment to the `right` of the decimal ends with `"0"`, as these are not allowed.

Note that this process could result in an empty answer, such as for the case `S = "(000)"`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^3)$$, where $$N$$ is the length `S`.  We evaluate the sum $$O(\sum_k k(N-k))$$.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N^3)$$, to store the answer.
