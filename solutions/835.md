#### Approach #1: Grouping [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Instead of thinking about connected components in `G`, think about them in the linked list.  Connected components in `G` must occur consecutively in the linked list.

**Algorithm**

Scanning through the list, if `node.val` is in `G` and `node.next.val` isn't (including if `node.next` is `null`), then this must be the end of a connected component.

For example, if the list is `0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7`, and `G = [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]`, then when scanning through the list, we fulfill the above condition at `0, 3, 5, 7`, for a total answer of `4`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N + G\text{.length})$$, where $$N$$ is the length of the linked list with root node `head`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(G\text{.length})$$, to store `Gset`.
