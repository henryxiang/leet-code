841. Shortest Distance to a Character | Algorithms | Easy | 

[TOC]

#### Approach #1: Min Array [Accepted]

**Intuition**

For each index `S[i]`, let's try to find the distance to the next character `C` going left, and going right.  The answer is the minimum of these two values.

**Algorithm**

When going left to right, we'll remember the index `prev` of the last character `C` we've seen.  Then the answer is `i - prev`.

When going right to left, we'll remember the index `prev` of the last character `C` we've seen.  Then the answer is `prev - i`.

We take the minimum of these two answers to create our final answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S`.  We scan through the string twice.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$, the size of `ans`.
