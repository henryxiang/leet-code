#### Approach #1: Hash Set [Accepted]

**Intuition**

If a card has the same value `x` on the front and back, it is impossible to win with `x`.  Otherwise, it has two different values, and if we win with `x`, we can put `x` face down on the rest of the cards.

**Algorithm**

Remember all values `same` that occur twice on a single card.  Then for every value `x` on any card that isn't in `same`, `x` is a candidate answer.  If we have no candidate answers, the final answer is zero.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `fronts` (and `backs`).  We scan through the arrays.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$.
