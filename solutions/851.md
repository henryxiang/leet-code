#### Approach #1: String [Accepted]

**Intuition**

We apply the steps given in the problem in a straightforward manner.  The difficulty lies in the implementation.

**Algorithm**

For each `word` in the sentence split, if it is a vowel we consider the word, otherwise we consider the rotation of the word (either `word[1:] + word[:1]` in Python, otherwise `word.substring(1) + word.substring(0, 1)` in Java).

Afterwards, we add `"ma"`, the desired number of `"a"`'s, and a space character.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S`.  This represents the complexity of rotating the word and adding extra `"a"` characters.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N^2)$$, the space added to the answer by adding extra `"a"` characters.
