#### Approach #1: Counting [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Instead of processing all `20000` people, we can process pairs of `(age, count)` representing how many people are that age.  Since there are only 120 possible ages, this is a much faster loop.

**Algorithm**

For each pair `(ageA, countA)`, `(ageB, countB)`, if the conditions are satisfied with respect to age, then `countA * countB` pairs of people made friend requests.

If `ageA == ageB`, then we overcounted: we should have `countA * (countA - 1)` pairs of people making friend requests instead, as you cannot friend request yourself.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A}^2 + N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of people, and $$\mathcal{A}$$ is the number of ages.

* Space Complexity: $$O(\mathcal{A})$$, the space used to store `count`.
