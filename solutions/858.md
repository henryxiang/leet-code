#### Approach #1: Direct [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We perform the algorithm as described.

First, to check if information is an email, we check whether it contains a `'@'`.  (There are many different tests: we could check for letters versus digits, for example.)

If we have an email, we should replace the first name with the first letter of that name, followed by 5 asterisks, followed by the last letter of that name.

If we have a phone number, we should collect all the digits and then format it according to the description.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(1)$$, if we consider the length of `S` as bounded by a constant.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$.
