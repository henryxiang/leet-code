#### Approach #1: Direct [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can do this in place.  In each row, the `i`th value from the left is equal to the inverse of the `i`th value from the right.

We use `(C+1) / 2` (with floor division) to iterate over all indexes `i` in the first half of the row, including the center.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where `N` is the total number of elements in `A`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(1)$$ in *additional* space complexity.
