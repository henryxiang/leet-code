#### Approach #1: Translate by Delta [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each translation `delta`, we calculate the candidate answer `overlap(delta)`, which is the size of the overlap if we shifted the matrix `A` by delta.

We only need to check `delta` for which some point in `A` maps to some point in `B`, since a candidate overlap must be at least 1.  Using a Set `seen`, we remember if we've calculated `overlap(delta)`, so that we don't perform this expensive check more than once per `delta`.

We use `java.awt.Point` (or `complex` in Python) to handle our 2D vectors gracefully.  We could have also mapped a vector `delta = (x, y)` (which has coordinates between `-(N-1)` and `N-1`) to `2*N x + y` for convenience.  Note that we cannot map it to `N*dx, dy` as there would be interference: `(0, N-1)` and `(1, -1)` would map to the same point.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^6)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A` or `B`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N^2)$$.

#### Approach #2: Count by Delta [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can do the reverse of *Approach #1*: count every possible `delta = b - a` we see.  If we see say, 5 of the same `delta = b - a`, then the translation by `delta` must have overlap 5.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^4)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A` or `B`.

* Space Complexity: $$O(N^2)$$.
