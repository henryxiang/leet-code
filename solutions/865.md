#### Approach 1: Spiral Backtracking

**Concepts to use**

Let's use here two programming concepts.

> The first one is called _constrained programming_. 

That basically means
to put restrictions after each robot move. Robot moves, and the cell is marked as `visited`. 
That propagates 
_constraints_ and helps to reduce the number of combinations to consider.

> The second one called _backtracking_. 

Let's imagine that after several moves the robot is surrounded by the visited cells. 
But several steps before there was a cell which proposed an alternative path to go. 
That path wasn't used and hence the room is not yet cleaned up. 
What to do? _To backtrack_. 
That means to come back to that cell,
and to explore the alternative path.

**Intuition**

This solution is based on the same idea as maze solving algorithm called [right-hand rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm#Wall_follower).
Go forward, cleaning and marking all the cells on the way
as visited. At the obstacle _turn right_, again go forward, _etc_. 
Always _turn right_ at the obstacles and then go forward. 
Consider already visited cells as 
virtual obstacles.

> What do do if after the right turn there is an obstacle just in front ?

_Turn right_ again.

> How to explore the alternative paths from the cell ? 

Go back to that cell
and then _turn right_ from your last explored direction.

> When to stop ?

Stop when you explored all possible paths, _i.e._ 
all `4` directions (up, right, down, and left) for each visited cell.

**Algorithm**

Time to write down the algorithm for the backtrack function 
`backtrack(cell = (0, 0), direction = 0)`.

- Mark the cell as visited and clean it up.

- Explore `4` directions : `up`, `right`, `down`, and `left` (the order
is important since the idea is always to turn right) : 

    - Check the next cell in the chosen direction :
    
        - If it's not visited yet and there is no obtacles :
            
            - Move forward.
            
            - Explore next cells `backtrack(new_cell, new_direction)`.
            
            - Backtrack, _i.e._ go back to the previous cell.
            
        - Turn right because now there is an obstacle 
        (or a virtual obstacle) just in front.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(4^{N - M})$$, where $$N$$ is a number of cells
in the room and $$M$$ is a number of obstacles, because for each cell
the algorithm checks 4 directions.

* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(N - M)$$, where $$N$$ is a number of cells
in the room and $$M$$ is a number of obstacles, to track visited cells.
