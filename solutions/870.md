#### Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's check every 3x3 grid individually.  For each grid, all numbers must be unique and between 1 and 9; plus every row, column, and diagonal must have the same sum.

**Extra Credit**

We could also include an `if grid[r+1][c+1] != 5: continue` check into our code, helping us skip over our `for r... for c...` for loops faster.  This is based on the following observations:

* The sum of the grid must be 45, as it is the sum of the distinct values from 1 to 9.
* Each horizontal and vertical line must add up to 15, as the sum of 3 of these lines equals the sum of the whole grid.
* The diagonal lines must also sum to 15, by definition of the problem statement.
* Adding the 12 values from the four lines that cross the center, these 4 lines add up to 60; but they also add up to the entire grid (45), plus 3 times the middle value.  This implies the middle value is 5.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(R*C)$$, where $$R, C$$ are the number of rows and columns in the given `grid`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
