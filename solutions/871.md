#### Approach #1: Depth-First Search [Accepted]

**Intuition and Algorithm**

When visiting a room for the first time, look at all the keys in that room.  For any key that hasn't been used yet, add it to the todo list (`stack`) for it to be used.

See the comments of the code for more details.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N + E)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of rooms, and $$E$$ is the total number of keys.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$ in additional space complexity, to store `stack` and `seen`.
