#### Approach #1: Brute Force [Accepted]

**Intuition**

We will repeatedly try to form a group (of size W) starting with the lowest card.  This works because the lowest card still in our hand must be the bottom end of a size `W` straight.

**Algorithm**

Let's keep a count `{card: number of copies of card}` as a `TreeMap` (or `dict`).

Then, repeatedly we will do the following steps: find the lowest value card that has 1 or more copies (say with value `x`), and try to remove `x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+W-1` from our count.  If we can't, then the task is impossible.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N * (N/W))$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `hand`.  The $$(N / W)$$ factor comes from `min(count)`.  In Java, the $$(N / W)$$ factor becomes $$\log N$$ due to the complexity of `TreeMap`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
