#### Approach 1 : Merge and sort

**Intuition**

The naive approach would be to merge both lists into one and then to sort.
It's a one line solution (2 lines in Java) with a pretty bad time complexity 
$$\mathcal{O}((n + m)\log(n + m))$$ because here one doesn't
profit from the fact that both arrays are already sorted.

**Implementation**



* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}((n + m)\log(n + m))$$. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(1)$$.

#### Approach 2 : Two pointers / Start from the beginning

**Intuition**

Typically, one could achieve $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$ time complexity
in a sorted array(s) with the help of _two pointers approach_.

The straightforward implementation would be to set get pointer
`p1` in the beginning of `nums1`, `p2` in the beginning of `nums2`,
and push the smallest value in the output array at each step.

Since `nums1` is an array used for output, one has to keep 
first `m` elements of `nums1` somewhere aside, 
that means $$\mathcal{O}(m)$$ space complexity
for this approach.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$. 
* Space complexity : $$\mathcal{O}(m)$$.

#### Approach 3 : Two pointers / Start from the end

**Intuition**

Approach 2 already demonstrates the best possible time 
complexity $$\mathcal{O}(n + m)$$ but still uses an additional space.
This is because one has to keep somewhere the elements of array `nums1`
while overwriting it starting from the beginning.

> What if we start to overwrite `nums1` from the end, where 
there is no information yet? Then no additional space is needed.

The set pointer `p` here 
is used to track the position of an added element.
