883. Car Fleet | Algorithms | Medium | Sort

[TOC]

---
#### Approach 1: Sort

**Intuition**

Call the "lead fleet" the fleet furthest in position.

If the car `S` (Second) behind the lead car `F` (First) would arrive earlier, then `S` forms a fleet with the lead car `F`.  Otherwise, fleet `F` is final as no car can catch up to it - cars behind `S` would form fleets with `S`, never `F`.

**Algorithm**

A car is a `(position, speed)` which implies some arrival time `(target - position) / speed`.  Sort the cars by position.

Now apply the above reasoning - if the lead fleet drives away, then count it and continue.  Otherwise, merge the fleets and continue.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of cars.  The complexity is dominated by the sorting operation.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, the space used to store information about the cars.
