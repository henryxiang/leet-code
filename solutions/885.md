#### Approach 1: Maintain Sorted Positions

**Intuition**

We'll maintain `ExamRoom.students`, a sorted `list` (or `TreeSet` in Java) of positions the students are currently seated in.

**Algorithm**

The `ExamRoom.leave(p)` operation is clear - we will just `list.remove` (or `TreeSet.remove`) the student from `ExamRoom.students`.

Let's focus on the `ExamRoom.seat() : int` operation.  For each pair of adjacent students `i` and `j`, the maximum distance to the closest student is `d = (j - i) / 2`, achieved in the left-most seat `i + d`.  Otherwise, we could also sit in the left-most seat, or the right-most seat.

Finally, we should handle the case when there are no students separately.

For more details, please review the comments made in the implementations.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  Each `seat` operation is $$O(P)$$, (where $$P$$ is the number of students sitting), as we iterate through every student.  Each `leave` operation is $$O(P)$$ ($$\log P$$ in Java).

* Space Complexity:  $$O(P)$$, the space used to store the positions of each student sitting.
