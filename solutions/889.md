#### Approach 1: Enumerate Cases

**Intuition**

Let's say `i` is *matched* if `A[i] == B[i]`, otherwise `i` is *unmatched*.  A buddy string has almost all matches, because a swap only affects two indices.

If swapping `A[i]` and `A[j]` would demonstrate that `A` and `B` are buddy strings, then `A[i] == B[j]` and `A[j] == B[i]`.  That means among the four free variables `A[i], A[j], B[i], B[j]`, there are only two cases: either `A[i] == A[j]` or not.

**Algorithm**

Let's work through the cases.

In the case `A[i] == A[j] == B[i] == B[j]`, then the strings `A` and `B` are equal.  So if `A == B`, we should check each index `i` for two matches with the same value.

In the case `A[i] == B[j], A[j] == B[i], (A[i] != A[j])`, the rest of the indices match.  So if `A` and `B` have only two unmatched indices (say `i` and `j`), we should check that the equalities `A[i] == B[j]` and `A[j] == B[i]` hold.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A` and `B`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
