#### Approach 1: Simulation

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's try to simulate giving change to each customer buying lemonade.  Initially, we start with no `five` dollar bills, and no `ten` dollar bills.

* If a customer brings a $5 bill, then we take it.

* If a customer brings a $10 bill, we must return a five dollar bill.  If we don't have a five dollar bill, the answer is `False`, since we can't make correct change.

* If a customer brings a $20 bill, we must return $15.

    * If we have a $10 and a $5, then we always prefer giving change in that, because it is strictly worse for making change than three $5 bills.

    * Otherwise, if we have three $5 bills, then we'll give that.

    * Otherwise, we won't be able to give $15 in change, and the answer is `False`.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `bills`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
