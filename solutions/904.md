#### Approach 1: Depth First Search

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let's find the leaf value sequence for both given trees.  Afterwards, we can compare them to see if they are equal or not.

To find the leaf value sequence of a tree, we use a depth first search.  Our `dfs` function writes the node's value if it is a leaf, and then recursively explores each child.  This is guaranteed to visit each leaf in left-to-right order, as left-children are fully explored before right-children.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(T_1 + T_2)$$, where $$T_1, T_2$$ are the lengths of the given trees.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(T_1 + T_2)$$, the space used in storing the leaf values.
