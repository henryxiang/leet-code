#### Approach 1: Simulation

**Intuition**

We simulate the path of the robot step by step.  Since there are at most 90000 steps, this is efficient enough to pass the given input limits.

**Algorithm**

We store the robot's position and direction.  If we get a turning command, we update the direction; otherwise we walk the specified number of steps in the given direction.

Care must be made to use a `Set` data structure for the obstacles, so that we can check efficiently if our next step is obstructed.  If we don't, our check `is point in obstacles` could be ~10,000 times slower.

In some languages, we need to encode the coordinates of each obstacle as a `long` integer so that it is a hashable key that we can put into a `Set` data structure.  Alternatively, we could also encode the coordinates as a `string`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N + K)$$, where $$N, K$$ are the lengths of `commands` and `obstacles` respectively.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(K)$$, the space used in storing the `obstacleSet`.
