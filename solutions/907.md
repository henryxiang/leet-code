#### Approach 1: Binary Search

**Intuition**

If Koko can finish eating all the bananas (within `H` hours) with an eating speed of `K`, she can finish with a larger speed too.

If we let `possible(K)` be `true` if and only if Koko can finish with an eating speed of `K`, then there is some `X` such that `possible(K) = True` if and only if `K >= X`.

For example, with `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]` and `H = 8`, there is some `X = 4` so that `possible(1) = possible(2) = possible(3) = False`, and `possible(4) = possible(5) = ... = True`.

**Algorithm**

We can binary search on the values of `possible(K)` to find the first `X` such that `possible(X)` is `True`: that will be our answer.  Our loop invariant will be that `possible(hi)` is always `True`, and `lo` is always less than or equal to the answer.  For more information on binary search, please visit [[LeetCode Explore - Binary Search]](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/).

To find the value of `possible(K)`, (ie. whether `Koko` with an eating speed of `K` can eat all bananas in `H` hours), we simulate it.  For each pile of size `p > 0`, we can deduce that Koko finishes it in `Math.ceil(p / K) = ((p-1) // K) + 1` hours, and we add these times across all piles and compare it to `H`.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log W)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of piles, and $$W$$ is the maximum size of a pile.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
