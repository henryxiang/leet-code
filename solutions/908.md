#### Approach 1: Output to Array

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Put every node into an array `A` in order.  Then the middle node is just `A[A.length // 2]`, since we can retrieve each node by index.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the given list.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, the space used by `A`.

#### Approach 2: Fast and Slow Pointer

**Intuition and Algorithm**

When traversing the list with a pointer `slow`, make another pointer `fast` that traverses twice as fast.  When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` must be in the middle.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the given list.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$, the space used by `slow` and `fast`.
