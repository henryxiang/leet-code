#### Approach 1: Prefix Sum and Binary Search

**Intuition**

Let $$\text{tot} = \sum_\limits{i=0}^{N-1}w[i]$$, where $$N = \text{len}(w)$$.

What if we randomly picked an integer in the [half-closed range](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Half-ClosedInterval.html) $$[0,\text{tot})$$?

Is there a way to map each possible integer to an index in $$w$$, such that the number of integers that map to each index is proportional to the index weights?

Is there a way to do this using less than $$O(\text{tot})$$ space?

**Algorithm**

Compute the prefix sum array $$p$$, where $$p[x] = \sum_\limits{i=0}^{x}w[i]$$.

Generate a random integer $$\text{targ}$$ in the range $$[0, \text{tot})$$.

Use binary search to find the index $$x$$ where $$x$$ is the lowest index such that $$\text{targ} < p[x]$$.

For some index $$i$$, all integers $$v$$ where $$p[i] - w[i] \leq v < p[i]$$ map to this index. Therefore, indexes will be sampled proportionally to the index weights.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity: $$O(N)$$ preprocessing. $$O(\log(N))$$ $$\text{pickIndex}$$.
* Space Complexity: $$O(N)$$
