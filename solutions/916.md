#### Approach 1: Work Backwards

**Intuition**

If we have a decoded string like `appleappleappleappleappleapple` and an index like `K = 24`, the answer is the same if `K = 4`.

In general, when a decoded string is equal to some word with `size` length repeated some number of times (such as `apple` with `size = 5` repeated 6 times), the answer is the same for the index `K` as it is for the index `K % size`.

We can use this insight by working backwards, keeping track of the size of the decoded string.  Whenever the decoded string would equal some `word` repeated `d` times, we can reduce `K` to `K % (word.length)`.

**Algorithm**

First, find the length of the decoded string.  After, we'll work backwards, keeping track of `size`: the length of the decoded string after parsing symbols `S[0], S[1], ..., S[i]`.

If we see a digit `S[i]`, it means the size of the decoded string after parsing `S[0], S[1], ..., S[i-1]` will be `size / Integer(S[i])`.  Otherwise, it will be `size - 1`.




**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
