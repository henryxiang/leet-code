920. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences | Algorithms | Easy | Hash Table

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Counting

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Every uncommon word occurs exactly once in total.  We can count the number of occurrences of every word, then return ones that occur exactly once.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(M + N)$$, where $$M, N$$ are the lengths of `A` and `B` respectively.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(M + N)$$, the space used by `count`.
