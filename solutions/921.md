#### Approach 1: Walk in a Spiral

**Intuition**

We can walk in a spiral shape from the starting square, ignoring whether we stay in the grid or not.  Eventually, we must have reached every square in the grid.

**Algorithm**

Examining the lengths of our walk in each direction, we find the following pattern: `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...`  That is, we walk 1 unit east, then 1 unit south, then 2 units west, then 2 units north, then 3 units east, etc.  Because our walk is self-similar, this pattern repeats in the way we expect.

After, the algorithm is straightforward: perform the walk and record positions of the grid in the order we visit them.  Please read the inline comments for more details.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O((\max(R, C))^2)$$.  Potentially, our walk needs to spiral until we move $$R$$ in one direction, and $$C$$ in another direction, so as to reach every cell of the grid.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(R * C)$$, the space used by the answer.
