#### Approach 1: Square by Square

**Intuition**

Let's try to count the surface area contributed by `v = grid[i][j]`.

When `v > 0`, the top and bottom surface contributes an area of 2.

Then, for each side (west side, north side, east side, south side) of the column at `grid[i][j]`, the neighboring cell with value `nv` means our square contributes `max(v - nv, 0)`.

For example, for `grid = [[1, 5]]`, the contribution at `grid[0][1]` is 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4.  The 2 comes from the top and bottom side, the 5 comes from the north, east, and south side; and the 4 comes from the west side, of which 1 unit is covered by the adjacent column.

**Algorithm**

For each `v = grid[r][c] > 0`, count `ans += 2`, plus `ans += max(v - nv, 0)` for each neighboring value `nv` adjacent to `grid[r][c]`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of rows (and columns) in the `grid`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
