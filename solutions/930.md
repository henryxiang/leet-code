#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let $$\text{FBT}(N)$$ be the list of all possible full binary trees with $$N$$ nodes.

Every full binary tree $$T$$ with 3 or more nodes, has 2 children at its root.  Each of those children `left` and `right` are themselves full binary trees.

Thus, for $$N \geq 3$$, we can formulate the recursion: $$\text{FBT}(N) =$$ [All trees with left child from $$\text{FBT}(x)$$ and right child from $$\text{FBT}(N-1-x)$$, for all $$x$$].

Also, by a simple counting argument, there are no full binary trees with a positive, even number of nodes.

Finally, we should cache previous results of the function $$\text{FBT}$$ so that we don't have to recalculate them in our recursion.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$.  For odd $$N$$, let $$N = 2k + 1$$.  Then, $$\Big| \text{FBT}(N) \Big| = C_k$$, the $$k$$-th catalan number; and $$\sum\limits_{k < \frac{N}{2}} C_k$$ (the complexity involved in computing intermediate results required) is bounded by $$O(2^N)$$.  However, the proof is beyond the scope of this article.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$.
