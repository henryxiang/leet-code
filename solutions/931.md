#### Approach 1: Stack of Stacks

**Intuition**

Evidently, we care about the frequency of an element.  Let `freq` be a `Map` from $$x$$ to the number of occurrences of $$x$$.

Also, we (probably) care about `maxfreq`, the current maximum frequency of any element in the stack.  This is clear because we must pop the element with the maximum frequency.

The main question then becomes: among elements with the same (maximum) frequency, how do we know which element is most recent?  We can use a stack to query this information: the top of the stack is the most recent.

To this end, let `group` be a map from frequency to a stack of elements with that frequency.  We now have all the required components to implement `FreqStack`.

**Algorithm**

Actually, as an implementation level detail, if `x` has frequency `f`, then we'll have `x` in all `group[i] (i <= f)`, not just the top.  This is because each `group[i]` will store information related to the `i`th copy of `x`.

Afterwards, our goal is just to maintain `freq`, `group`, and `maxfreq` as described above.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(1)$$ for both `push` and `pop` operations.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where `N` is the number of elements in the `FreqStack`.
