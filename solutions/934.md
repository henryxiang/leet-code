#### Approach 1: Frontier Set

**Intuition**

Let's try to speed up a brute force answer.  Evidently, the brute force approach is to calculate every result `result(i, j) = A[i] | A[i+1] | ... | A[j]`.  We can speed this up by taking note of the fact that `result(i, j+1) = result(i, j) | A[j+1]`.  Naively, this approach has time complexity $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of the array.

Actually, this approach can be better than that.  At the `k`th step, say we have all the `result(i, k)` in some set `cur`.  Then we can find the next `cur` set (for `k -> k+1`) by using `result(i, k+1) = result(i, k) | A[k+1]`.

However, the number of unique values in this set `cur` is at most 32, since the list `result(k, k), result(k-1, k), result(k-2, k), ...` is monotone increasing, and any subsequent values that are different must have more 1s in it's binary representation (to a maximum of 32 ones).

**Algorithm**

In the `k`th step, we'll maintain `cur`: the set of results `A[i] | ... | A[k]` for all `i`.  These results will be included in our final answer set.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log W)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`, and $$W$$ is the maximum size of elements in `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N \log W)$$, the size of the answer.
