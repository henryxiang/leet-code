**Intuition and Algorithm**

Let `A` be the original array, and `B` be the array after all our modifications.  Towards trying to minimize `max(B) - min(B)`, let's try to minimize `max(B)` and maximize `min(B)` separately.

The smallest possible value of `max(B)` is `max(A) - K`, as the value `max(A)` cannot go lower.  Similarly, the largest possible value of `min(B)` is `min(A) + K`.  So the quantity `max(B) - min(B)` is at least `ans = (max(A) - K) - (min(A) + K)`.

We can attain this value (if `ans >= 0`), by the following modifications:

* If $$A[i] \leq \min(A) + K$$, then $$B[i] = \min(A) + K$$
* Else, if $$A[i] \geq \max(A) - K$$, then $$B[i] = \max(A) - K$$
* Else, $$B[i] = A[i]$$.

If `ans < 0`, the best answer we could have is `ans = 0`, also using the same modification.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
