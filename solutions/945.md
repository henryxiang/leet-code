#### Approach 1: Breadth-First Search

**Intuition**

As we are looking for a shortest path, a breadth-first search is ideal.  The main difficulty is to handle enumerating all possible moves from each square.

**Algorithm**

Suppose we are on a square with number `s`.  We would like to know all final destinations with number `s2` after making one move.

This requires knowing the coordinates `get(s2)` of square `s2`.  This is a small puzzle in itself: we know that the row changes every `N` squares, and so is only based on `quot = (s2-1) / N`; also the column is only based on `rem = (s2-1) % N` and what row we are on (forwards or backwards.)

From there, we perform a breadth first search, where the nodes are the square numbers `s`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of the `board`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$.
