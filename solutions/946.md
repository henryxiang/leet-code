#### Approach 1: Linear Scan

**Intuition**

As in *Smallest Range I*, smaller `A[i]` will choose to increase their value ("go up"), and bigger `A[i]` will decrease their value ("go down").

**Algorithm**

We can formalize the above concept: if `A[i]  b` denotes `(b, a)` instead.)

That means that it is never worse to choose `(up, down)` instead of `(down, up)`.  We can prove this claim that one interval is a subset of another, by showing both `A[i] + K` and `A[j] - K` are between `A[i] - K` and `A[j] + K`.

For sorted `A`, say `A[i]` is the largest `i` that goes up.  Then `A[0] + K, A[i] + K, A[i+1] - K, A[A.length - 1] - K` are the only relevant values for calculating the answer: every other value is between one of these extremal values.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of the `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$, plus the space used by the builtin sorting algorithm.
