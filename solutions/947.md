#### Approach 1: List of Lists + Binary Search

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We can store the votes in a list `A` of lists of votes.  Each vote has a person and a timestamp, and `A[count]` is a list of the `count`-th votes received for that person.

Then, `A[i][0]` and `A[i]` are monotone increasing, so we can binary search on them to find the most recent vote by time.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N + Q \log^2 N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of votes, and $$Q$$ is the number of queries.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: Precomputed Answer + Binary Search

**Intuition and Algorithm**

As the votes come in, we can remember every event `(winner, time)` when the winner changes.  After, we have a sorted list of these events that we can binary search for the answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N + Q \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of votes, and $$Q$$ is the number of queries.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
