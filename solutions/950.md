#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

We can try every possible `X`.  

**Algorithm**

Since we divide the deck of `N` cards into say, `K` piles of `X` cards each, we must have `N % X == 0`.

Then, say the deck has `C_i` copies of cards with number `i`.  Each group with number `i` has `X` copies, so we must have `C_i % X == 0`.  These are necessary and sufficient conditions.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2 \log \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of cards.  It is outside the scope of this article to prove that the number of divisors of $$N$$ is bounded by $$O(N \log \log N)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: Greatest Common Divisor

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Again, say there are `C_i` cards of number `i`.  These must be broken down into piles of `X` cards each, ie. `C_i % X == 0` for all `i`.

Thus, `X` must divide the greatest common divisor of `C_i`.  If this greatest common divisor `g` is greater than `1`, then `X = g` will satisfy.  Otherwise, it won't.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log^2 N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of votes.  If there are $$C_i$$ cards with number $$i$$, then each `gcd` operation is naively $$O(\log^2 C_i)$$.  Better bounds exist, but are outside the scope of this article to develop.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
