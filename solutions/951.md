#### Approach 1: Next Array

**Intuition**

Instead of checking whether `all(L <= R for L in left for R in right)`, let's check whether `max(left) <= min(right)`.

**Algorithm**

Let's try to find `max(left)` for subarrays `left = A[:1], left = A[:2], left =  A[:3], ...` etc.  Specifically, `maxleft[i]` will be the maximum of subarray `A[:i]`.  They are related to each other: `max(A[:4]) = max(max(A[:3]), A[3])`, so `maxleft[4] = max(maxleft[3], A[3])`.

Similarly, `min(right)` for every possible `right` can be found in linear time.

After we have a way to query `max(left)` and `min(right)` quickly, the solution is straightforward.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
