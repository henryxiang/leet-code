965. Unique Email Addresses | Algorithms | Easy | String

[TOC]

## Solution

#### Approach 1: Canonical Form

**Intuition and Algorithm**

For each email address, convert it to the *canonical* address that actually receives the mail.  This involves a few steps:

* Separate the email address into a `local` part and the `rest` of the address.

* If the `local` part has a `'+'` character, remove it and everything beyond it from the `local` part.

* Remove all the zeros from the `local` part.

* The canonical address is `local + rest`.

After, we can count the number of unique canonical addresses with a `Set` structure.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{C})$$, where $$\mathcal{C}$$ is the total content of `emails`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{C})$$.
