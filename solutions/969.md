969. Number of Recent Calls | Algorithms | Easy | Queue

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Queue

**Intuition**

We only care about the most recent calls in the last 3000 ms, so let's use a data structure that keeps only those.

**Algorithm**

Keep a queue of the most recent calls in increasing order of `t`.  When we see a new call with time `t`, remove all calls that occurred before `t - 3000`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(Q)$$, where $$Q$$ is the number of queries made.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(W)$$, where $$W = 3000$$ is the size of the window we should scan for recent calls.  In this problem, the complexity can be considered $$O(1)$$.
