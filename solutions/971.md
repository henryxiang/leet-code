#### Approach 1: Find and Grow

**Intuition**

Conceptually, our method is very straightforward: find both islands, then for one of the islands, keep "growing" it by 1 until we touch the second island.

We can use a depth-first search to find the islands, and a breadth-first search to "grow" one of them.  This leads to a verbose but correct solution.

**Algorithm**

To find both islands, look for a square with a `1` we haven't visited, and dfs to get the component of that region.  Do this twice.  After, we have two components `source` and `target`.

To find the shortest bridge, do a BFS from the nodes `source`.  When we reach any node in `target`, we will have found the shortest distance.

Please see the code for more implementation details.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A})$$, where $$\mathcal{A}$$ is the content of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A})$$.
