#### Approach 1: Dynamic Programming

**Intuition**

Let `f(start, n)` be the number of ways to dial an `n` digit number, where the knight starts at square `start`.  We can create a recursion, writing this in terms of `f(x, n-1)`'s.

**Algorithm**

By hand or otherwise, have a way to query what moves are available at each square.  This implies the exact recursion for `f`.  For example, from `1` we can move to `6, 8`, so `f(1, n) = f(6, n-1) + f(8, n-1)`.

After, let's keep track of `dp[start] = f(start, n)`, and update it for each n from `1, 2, ..., N`.

At the end, the answer is `f(0, N) + f(1, N) + ... + f(9, N) = sum(dp)`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
