#### Approach 1: Custom Sort

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Instead of sorting in the default order, we'll sort in a custom order we specify.

The rules are:

* Letter-logs come before digit-logs;
* Letter-logs are sorted alphanumerically, by content then identifier;
* Digit-logs remain in the same order.

It is straightforward to translate these ideas into code.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A}\log \mathcal{A})$$, where $$\mathcal{A}$$ is the total content of `logs`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A})$$.
