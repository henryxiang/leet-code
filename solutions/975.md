#### Approach 1: Depth First Search

**Intuition and Algorithm**

We traverse the tree using a depth first search.  If `node.val` falls outside the range `[L, R]`, (for example `node.val < L`), then we know that only the right branch could have nodes with value inside `[L, R]`.

We showcase two implementations - one using a recursive algorithm, and one using an iterative one.

**Recursive Implementation**



**Iterative Implementation**



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(H)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the tree.
