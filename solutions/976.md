#### Approach 1: Sort by Column

**Intuition**

Count each rectangle by right-most edge.

**Algorithm**

Group the points by `x` coordinates, so that we have columns of points.  Then, for every pair of points in a column (with coordinates `(x,y1)` and `(x,y2)`), check for the smallest rectangle with this pair of points as the rightmost edge.  We can do this by keeping memory of what pairs of points we've seen before.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `points`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.

#### Approach 2: Count by Diagonal

**Intuition**

For each pair of points in the array, consider them to be the long diagonal of a potential rectangle.  We can check if all 4 points are there using a Set.

For example, if the points are `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`, we check if we also have `(1, 5)` and `(5, 1)`.  If we do, we have a candidate rectangle.

**Algorithm**

Put all the points in a set.  For each pair of points, if the associated rectangle are 4 distinct points all in the set, then take the area of this rectangle as a candidate answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N^2)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `points`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$H$$ is the height of the tree.
