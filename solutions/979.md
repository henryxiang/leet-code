#### Approach 1: Ad-Hoc

**Intuition**

If we see say `S[0] == 'I'`, we can always put `0` as the first element; similarly, if we see `S[0] == 'D'`, we can always put `N` as the first element.

Say we have a match for the rest of the string `S[1], S[2], ...` using `N` distinct elements.  Notice it doesn't matter what the elements are, only that they are distinct and totally ordered.  Then, putting `0` or `N` at the first character will match, and the rest of the elements (`1, 2, ..., N` or `0, 1, ..., N-1`) can use the matching we have.

**Algorithm**

Keep track of the smallest and largest element we haven't placed.  If we see an `'I'`, place the small element; otherwise place the large element.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `S`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
