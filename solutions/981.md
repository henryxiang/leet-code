981. Delete Columns to Make Sorted | Algorithms | Easy | Greedy

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Greedy

**Intuition**

If a column isn't sorted, it can't be part of the final answer.

**Algorithm**

For each column, check if its sorted.  If it isn't, it must be deleted, so we add 1 to the final answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(\mathcal{A})$$, where $$\mathcal{A}$$ is the total *content* of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
