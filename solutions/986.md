986. Largest Time for Given Digits | Algorithms | Easy | Math

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

Try all possible times, and remember the largest one.

**Algorithm (Java)**

Iterate over all permutations `(i, j, k, l)` of `(0, 1, 2, 3)`.  For each permutation, we can try the time `A[i]A[j] : A[k]A[l]`.

This is a valid time if and only if the number of hours `10*A[i] + A[j]` is less than `24`; and the number of minutes `10*A[k] + A[l]` is less than `60`.

We will output the largest valid time.

**Algorithm (Python)**

For each possible ordering of the 4 digits, if it's a legal time and the time is greater than the one we have stored, update the answer.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(1)$$.
