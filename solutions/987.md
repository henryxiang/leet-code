987. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order | Algorithms | Medium | Array

[TOC]

## Solution
---
#### Approach 1: Simulation

**Intuition and Algorithm**

Simulate the revealing process with a deck set to `[0, 1, 2, ...]`.  If for example this deck is revealed in the order `[0, 2, 4, ...]` then we know we need to put the smallest card in index `0`, the second smallest card in index `2`, the third smallest card in index `4`, etc.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `deck`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
