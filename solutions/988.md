#### Approach 1: Recursion

**Intuition**

If `root1` and `root2` have the same root value, then we only need to check if their children are equal (up to ordering.)

**Algorithm**

There are 3 cases:

* If `root1` or `root2` is `null`, then they are equivalent if and only if they are both `null`.

* Else, if `root1` and `root2` have different values, they aren't equivalent.

* Else, let's check whether the children of `root1` are equivalent to the children of `root2`.  There are two different ways to pair these children.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(min(N_1, N_2))$$, where $$N_1, N_2$$ are the lengths of `root1` and `root2`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(min(H_1, H_2))$$, where $$H_1, H_2$$ are the heights of the trees of `root1` and `root2`.

#### Approach 2: Canonical Traversal

**Intuition**

Flip each node so that the left child is smaller than the right, and call this the *canonical representation*.  All equivalent trees have exactly one canonical representation.

**Algorithm**

We can use a depth-first search to compare the canonical representation of each tree.  If the traversals are the same, the representations are equal.

When traversing, we should be careful to encode both when we enter or leave a node.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N_1 + N_2)$$, where $$N_1, N_2$$ are the lengths of `root1` and `root2`.  (In Python, this is $$\min(N_1, N_2)$$.)

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N_1 + N_2)$$.  (In Python, this is $$\min(H_1, H_2)$$, where $$H_1, H_2$$ are the heights of the trees of `root1` and `root2`.)
