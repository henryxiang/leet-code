#### Approach 1: Greedy

**Intuition**

If `x` is currently the array element with the least absolute value, it must pair with `2*x`, as there does not exist any other `x/2` to pair with it.

**Algorithm**

Let's try to (virtually) "write" the final reordered array.

Let's check elements in order of absolute value.  When we check an element `x` and it isn't used, it must pair with `2*x`.  We will attempt to write `x, 2x` - if we can't, then the answer is `false`.  If we write everything, the answer is `true`.

To keep track of what we have not yet written, we will store it in a `count`.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N \log N)$$, where $$N$$ is the length of `A`.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
