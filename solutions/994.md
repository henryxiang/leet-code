#### Approach 1: Simulation

**Intuition**

We simulate each day of the prison.

Because there are at most 256 possible states for the prison, eventually the states repeat into a cycle rather quickly.  We can keep track of when the states repeat to find the period `t` of this cycle, and skip days in multiples of `t`.

**Algorithm**

Let's do a naive simulation, iterating one day at a time.  For each day, we will decrement `N`, the number of days remaining, and transform the state of the prison forward (`state -> nextDay(state)`).

If we reach a state we have seen before, we know how many days ago it occurred, say `t`.  Then, because of this cycle, we can do `N %= t`.  This ensures that our algorithm only needs $$O(2**{\text{cells.length}})$$ steps.



**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(2^N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of cells in the prison.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(2^N * N)$$.
